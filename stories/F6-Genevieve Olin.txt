Winter Story
The Ornament That Saved Christmas
By Genevieve Olin
Maddie had arrived at her grandma's house, the old person's smell and warm feeling comforting her in the cold winter—especially now, since there wasn’t much comfort in her life anymore after her dad died a couple months ago. After greeting her grandparents, she went upstairs to the guest room where she normally stayed, but something was different this time. A ladder was hanging down from the ceiling.
“Grandma, what does this ladder lead to?” she called.  
    “Oh, just the attic, dear, but there is nothing up there,” her grandmother replied.  
    Curiosity tugged at Maddie, and she climbed up the ladder into the attic. At first all she saw was dust and a small box tucked in the back corner.
Just as she was about to head back down, a tiny flash of light flickered from inside the box. Intrigued, she approached it. The closer she got, the brighter the light grew. But when she opened the box, all she found was an ornament. Feeling let down, she picked it up—only for it to begin flashing wildly. Startled, she dropped it, then slowly picked it up again. This time, inside the ornament was a picture of a family holding presents.
She stared, confused. The image hadn’t been there before. Leaning closer, she realized the picture was moving—and before she could react, she was transported inside the scene.  
    “Where am I?” she whispered over and over, staggering through a world filled with decorated trees, homes draped in sparkling lights, and families joyfully gathered around glowing displays.
It was unlike anything Maddie had ever seen, yet strangely familiar in a way she couldn’t explain. Then she saw it—the house. The same one from inside the ornament. As she approached and held up the ornament, she realized the scene before her matched perfectly. And in an instant, she was back in her grandma’s attic.
Night had fallen. Exhausted and shaken, Maddie went to bed hoping to forget the strange experience. But the next morning, when she awoke, she remembered everything. And there on the floor, the ornament was flashing again. She wanted to ignore it—she really did—but curiosity won. Inside, she saw a lonely girl crying.
This confused her. The village had been full of joy before. When she picked up the ornament, she was transported again. But this time the world was dim—no lights, no decorated trees, no warmth. Following the faint sound of crying, Maddie found a cabin with only a single, undecorated tree inside. A girl sat on the floor, sobbing.
When the door creaked, the girl looked up.  
    “Who’s there?”  
    Maddie stepped inside. “Um… hello. My name is Maddie.”  
    They spoke quietly, hesitantly. Maddie explained how the ornament had brought her here. The girl, whose name was Lila, finally admitted, “Everything is wrong.”
She explained that the world they were in was supposed to be celebrating something called Christmas. But she had made a wish—a terrible wish—that Christmas would disappear. She hadn’t meant for it to actually work. She had just been lonely. Since her dad died and her mom was always busy, Christmas only reminded her of what she’d lost.
Maddie’s heart ached. “I know what it’s like,” she said softly. “My dad died too. Everything feels empty now. But maybe… maybe Christmas isn’t the problem. Maybe you just needed someone who understands.”
Lila wiped her eyes and whispered, “Then I want to fix it. I wish for Christmas to come back.”  
    Light burst from the tree, warm and glowing, spreading across the village until everything was bright and joyful again.
The ornament shone brighter than ever before.  
    “I think my work here is done,” Maddie said.  
    Lila hugged her tightly. “Thank you.”  
    And in a blink, Maddie was back in her grandma’s attic.
When she went downstairs, she froze. Lights, ornaments, and wrapped presents filled the living room. Her grandmother turned to her, beaming.  
    “Merry Christmas, Maddie!”  
    Maddie gazed at the glowing tree, warmth blooming inside her—warmth she thought she would never feel again.

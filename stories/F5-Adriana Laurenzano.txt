The Naughty Boy on Christmas
The Naughty Boy on Christmas
By Adriana Laurenzano
Arthur was a 14 year-old boy who everyone in town agreed was the naughtiest kid they have ever met. He didn’t just break rules. He acted like rules are optional and only for other people. Teachers tried talking to him but he usually ignored them or made jokes. Neighbors complained that he stomped through gardens, made a lot of noisy, or set off fire crackers for fun. Even his parents had trouble keeping up with him because he always found new ways to cause trouble. He thought being wild made him interesting and he loved the attention. He had no idea that something much older and scarier had been watching him for a long time.
On Christmas Eve while most kids were drinking hot chocolate and watching movies, he was planning a huge prank. He wanted to make it the biggest Christmas memory ever, but in his mind that meant doing something chaotic. He walked to the town’s community center where the giant Christmas tree stood covered in lights and ornaments. The tree was special in the town because many kids had helped decorate it all there, looked at the shining ornaments and smirked, pulling out a slingshot. He aimed at a large glass ornament shaped like a silver star and his mind breaking it would be humorous.
Just as he pulled the band back all felt a sudden icy wind surrounding him. The lights on the tree flickered like something had disturbed the whole atmosphere. He slowly turned around, expecting maybe a parent or police officer. Instead he saw a tall shadowy figure with horns curling out on its head. The creature had thick, black fur, glowing, red eyes and hooves that scratched the ground like metal. A heavy chain hung from its shoulders and rattled with each breath. Arthur froze as the creature stepped closer.
The creature spoke in a deep voice that sounded like cracking ice. “ I’m Krampus, the watcher of the naughty.” Arthur had to convince himself, it was a prank or someone in a costume. He laughed nervously and said, “ Ok, very funny. Who hired you?” Krampus didn’t respond and only narrowed his glowing eyes before Arther could run. Krampus grabbed him with a clawed hand. Arthur screamed as he tossed it into a giant sack on the creature's back.
inside the sack, Arthur trembles onto a pile of rough objects that pooped him in the ribs. He heard muffled voices and realized other kids were in there too. They whispered that Krampus took the naughtiest children ever every Christmas Eve. Arthur didn’t want to believe it because the Sak smelled like old coal and snow, and it felt way too real, the ground disappeared beneath him as Krampus leaked into the sky. Arthur could feel the wind rushing pass, even though he was trapped in darkness. He curled up, wishing he had stayed home.
When the sack finally opened, Arthur rolled onto icy stone, he found himself inside a massive cave that glowed with blue flames, strange tools, chains and piles of coal filled the space almost like a workshop for nightmares. The other kids huddled together, scared to move, Krampus towered over Arthur and pointed at him. “ You will work,” he said. “ Unless you escape before Christmas ends.” Arthur’s heart pounded because that gave him only one day.
Arthur tried to act brave, but the mower he looked around the more hopeless things seemed. The cave had no windows and only one huge gate covered with thick ice. Every time a child touched it. The ice cracked and burned their fingers with cold. Arthur kicked the ground in frustration, angry that he had been caught. He thought of all the terrible things he has done back home and wondered if this was karma catching up with him for the first time. He felt regret instead of pride when he realized he needed a plan fast.
Arthur spent the next hour watching Krampus work. The creature carved symbols into wood boxes and tossed coal into strange machines. Arthur noticed that Krampus always left a large iron key hanging on the wall near his workbench. It looks like the kind of key that could unlock something important Arthur whispered to another kid, but most were too scared to help still Arthur knew he couldn’t escape alone. He decided that if he ever wanted to go home, he needed courage, not attitude.
When Krampus turned his back, Arthur made his move. He crept across the cave, staying quiet as his breath floated in the cold air. His heart pounded so loud he was sure Krampus would hear it. He reached the workbench and grab the giant key. It was heavier than he expected, and it collided softly, Krampus paws for a moment, sniff the air and author holds his breath. After a few seconds the creature went back to his work and Arthur carefully backed away.
Arthur ran to the frozen gate and fit the key into the lock. The other kids would watch with wide, hopeful eyes. He twisted the key, and the gate shook as the ice cracked. A blinding light burst through the opening, revealing a snowy forest outside. Arthur yelled for everyone to run and they sprinted through the gap beneath him. Krampus roared angry and upset. Arthur didn’t look back.
The force was frozen. The snow reached up to Arthur‘s knees. He kept helping the younger kids climb over fallen logs and push through deep drafts. The sky above them glowed with whirling northern lights, reminding Arthur how close Christmas morning was. Krampus footsteps echo in the distance, shaking the ground Arthur refused to let fear stop him now he kept pushing forward, determined to make it home.
Finally, Arthur saw the warm glow of the towns light through the trees. The kids cheered, but Arthur knew Krampus was still chasing them when they reached the park. Arthur turned and face the darkness. He shouted “ I’m done being naughty! I’m not that kid anymore!” The forest felt silent as if listening for a moment Arthur thought nothing would happen.
Then Krampus appeared as the edge of the trees started, stared straight at Arthur instead of attacking the creature slowly nodded. “ you have learned.” Growled the chains on its shoulders rattled softly almost like approval instead of warning then Krampus stepped back into the shadows. The darkness swallowed him hole and he disappeared like smoke. Arthur let out a long breath. He didn’t realize he’d been holding.
When Arthur returned home, his parents hugged him tight, shocked to see him outside so late. Arthur didn’t tell them any everything, but he promised he would change for the first time he meant it the next morning he helped his neighbor shovel snow without being asked he apologized to his teachers after winter break Arthur knew he would never be perfect, but he also knew he would never be “ the naughtiest kid ever” again.

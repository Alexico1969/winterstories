Winter Story
by Sophia
She stood on the balls of her feet, adjusting an ornament on her Christmas tree. It was a pleasant morning, brisk air brushed her back from the partly opened window. Outside the sun was just starting to rise, and it made the thick layer of snow outside sparkle.
She hummed softly as she stretched her back,looking back at the tree. The tree didn’t look perfect, it had a gap in the branches and seemed to be a little lopsided. But it was all she could afford and it's not like anyone else was coming to celebrate Christmas Eve with her. It would just be her and husband.
She stepped into the kitchen and began to prepare a fine breakfast. Christmas music drifted through the house, blending with the soft crackle of sizzling bacon.
“Carol…?” she heard her husband call.
“Coming!” she called back, arranging all the food neatly on a tray before carrying it to him. Sliding beside him on the bed, she rested her head on his shoulder and whispered a small, “Merry Christmas Eve.”
Carol already knew exactly how this Christmas Eve was going to be. She already knew the presents, too. It would be the same perfume her husband bought her every year—Noelle #5—and she had gotten him his favorite cologne, just as she always did.
She whispered, “What do you want to do first? Watch a movie?”
He nodded, and she couldn’t help but grin at the small, familiar gesture. She waited patiently for him to finish his breakfast, then guided him into the living room, their fingers intertwined as they walked. They never planned anything extravagant for the holidays anymore—just quiet moments together, simply enjoying each other’s presence.
Carol grabbed the remote and clicked on Home Alone, the opening music filling the dimly lit room. She pulled a blanket over both of them, noticing how cold her husband felt beneath her touch. It was strange—he wasn’t usually this chilled. Maybe it was from the open window in the bedroom, she thought, though something about it still tugged at her mind.
As the movie played, her thoughts drifted to years long gone. There was a time when Christmas for them had been extravagant—lavish dinners at expensive restaurants on Christmas Eve, lights covering every inch of their home as if Santa himself were coming to admire their work. Even though they lived miles away from anyone, tucked far from society in their secluded corner of the world, they decorated as if the whole town would see. It used to feel magical.
But those days had slipped away, little by little, until the cost of everything became too heavy for her to carry. Now their holidays were simpler, quieter. Still, as she leaned against him, she let the memories dissolve and returned her attention to the screen.
Her husband’s hand slowly wrapped around her shoulder, warm and familiar, and she let herself melt into the moment, grateful for what she had. By the time the movie ended, the sun had climbed high enough to brighten the whole living room. It was already midday. Carol had been planning to get a little drunk later—just enough to warm her chest and soften the evening—but that would have to wait. For now, dinner needed to be started.
She pressed a gentle kiss to her husband’s forehead before slipping out of the room and heading back into the kitchen. Their Christmas dinner wasn’t anything extravagant anymore, but it was theirs. It usually consisted of roasted vegetables, a small glazed ham, and her homemade mashed potatoes—comfort foods that carried years’ worth of memories.
With a small sigh, she tied her hair into a loose bun and began to work, moving around the kitchen with a practiced rhythm. Every so often she stole a glance at her husband on the couch, the sight of him making her chest warm. She loved that man more deeply than she could ever put into words. Nothing could ruin this Christmas Eve, she thought.
Her warm thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the putrid smell of something burning. She gasped and rushed to the stove. “Oh dear!” The vegetables were scorched at the edges, smoking lightly. She snatched the pan off the heat, blowing on it uselessly, as if that would reverse time. Well… no matter. She could always make another batch.
The rest of the meal took her hours, three, maybe four, but she didn’t mind. She wanted everything to be perfect for Charles. Perfect for the two of them.
When everything was finally arranged on the table, she wiped her hands on a towel and called out, “Charles, dinner’s ready!” Her voice echoed through the quiet house.
She waited for the familiar shuffle, the soft reply, the sound of him getting up—but nothing came. Puzzled, she peeked into the living room. He was still in the exact same position as before, staring ahead, unmoving. That was odd. He usually reacted right away.
Concern nudged at her, and she stepped fully into the room. “Charles?” she tried again, this time gentler. She placed her hand on his shoulder and gave it a light shake. Still nothing.
Trying to keep her worry hidden beneath a smile, she took his hand into hers, his fingers cold against her warm palm, and gently guided him up from the couch. “Come on, sweetheart,” she murmured, coaxing him toward
By the time dinner was finished, night had already settled in—perfect for opening a bottle of champagne. She filled both their glasses and drank until the alcohol warmed her cheeks and softened the edges of her thoughts. Laughing, she pulled her husband close, swaying with him to the soft Christmas music drifting through the room. It wasn’t a perfect night, not really, but with champagne fogging her mind, she no longer cared. They danced and danced. Carol felt giddy, pressing sloppy kisses to her husband’s lips before they eventually collapsed onto the couch.
It was a wonderful Christmas Eve.
…
Silence. that was the first thing she noticed when she woke on Christmas morning. Pure, heavy silence. She lay on the couch beside her husband. Her husband… who was dead.
She cried until her throat burned. He had been gone for years now, taken by a heart attack on Christmas Day, yet every Christmas Eve she cooked the same meal, watched the same movie, poured the same champagne. She recreated the night before he died, pretending he was still with her, unable to face the truth. Her delusion blurred the edges of reality, letting her believe, for a few precious hours, that he was alive and warm beside her. But he wasn’t. She was holding his corpse, clinging to it because she couldn’t bear to let him go.
She sobbed for hours before finally resting her head on his chest and falling asleep

Winter Story
by You
Once there was a boy named Evan, and Evan was known all around school for being bad and a bully. He didn’t listen to teachers, he didn’t care about what anyone said, and he acted like rules simply didn’t apply to him. He pushed kids out of line just because he felt like being first. He shouted across the hallways, rolled his eyes when teachers corrected him, and worst of all, he took things that didn’t belong to him. One day he snatched someone’s gloves and pretended they were his. The next day he reached into another kid’s backpack and grabbed their homework just to rip it up for fun. People learned to avoid him because they were tired of dealing with his bullying and because they never knew what he might do next.
As Christmas got closer, everyone in school was buzzing with excitement. Kids whispered about what they hoped to get, what their families were planning, and what treats would be waiting under their trees. Evan pretended not to care. Whenever someone brought up presents, he shrugged and made a bored face, acting like the whole holiday was pointless. But deep inside, hidden where no one could see, he hoped he’d get a huge pile of gifts just like everyone else. He imagined ripping open box after box, imagining new games, new clothes, new electronics, everything he ever wanted. After all, he thought, presents are for everyone, even someone like him.
On Christmas morning, sunlight peeked through his curtains, glowing soft and gold like it was inviting him into the perfect day. Evan jumped out of bed, heart pounding with excitement, and ran straight to the living room. He skidded across the floor in his socks and stopped in front of the Christmas tree, ready to see the mountain of gifts waiting for him.
But instead, his heart dropped so fast it felt like it disappeared. There were no presents. Not a single one. The tree stood quietly in the corner, its lights glowing softly, almost like it felt sorry for him. The ornaments shimmered, the star at the top shined, but beneath it sat nothing but the empty space where gifts should have been.
For a moment Evan just stared, thinking maybe he was still half-asleep, maybe the presents were hidden behind the couch or under the table, maybe his parents had moved them somewhere else. But no matter where he looked, the truth stayed the same. There were no presents for Evan. His stomach twisted, almost painfully. His throat felt tight. Why didn’t I get anything? he wondered. Is this some kind of mistake? Did someone forget about me?
And then, slowly, like a heavy weight dropping onto his shoulders, it hit him. Maybe this wasn’t a mistake at all. Maybe everything he had done was the reason why. The bullying. The shoving. The stealing. The way kids flinched or stepped aside when he walked by because they were scared he might do something to them. He thought about all the angry faces, all the upset voices, all the times he laughed when someone else felt bad. For the first time, Evan felt something he wasn’t used to feeling — guilty.
“I messed up,” he whispered, the words catching in his throat. He sank onto the couch, pulling his knees up, staring at the empty floor beneath the tree. The lights continued to glow, but now they seemed softer, almost like they were waiting for him to admit the truth. And he did. For the first time, he realized that maybe presents weren’t just something you automatically got every year. Maybe they were something you earned through kindness, good choices, and the way you treated others.
The next day, when school started again, Evan walked through the doors with a strange determination he hadn’t felt before. He wasn’t sure if anyone would believe him, but he knew he had to try. The first kid he found was the boy whose gloves he had stolen weeks ago. Evan held them out awkwardly and said, “These are yours… I’m sorry.” The boy stared for a moment, confused, but slowly took them back with a small nod.
Next, Evan found the kid whose homework he had taken and torn. He knew he couldn’t return it, but he apologized anyway. “I shouldn’t have done that. I’m really sorry,” he said quietly. The kid blinked in surprise, then gave a tiny shrug. “Thanks,” he said softly.
Evan went down the hall, finding every kid he had pushed, teased, or annoyed. Some were surprised. Some didn’t know what to say. A few waited, expecting him to laugh and say it was a joke. But he didn’t. Others smiled softly and said “It’s okay,” or “Thanks for apologizing.” Evan didn’t expect anyone to forgive him, but little by little, they did. And strangely, it felt better than getting presents ever. He felt lighter. Happier. Proud in a way he had never felt before.
But a small part of him still wished for the gifts he had hoped to open on Christmas. Still, he ended that night feeling proud of the boy he was trying to become. And for once, he went to sleep with a smile not because he expected presents, but because he knew he was changing.
The next morning, when Evan opened his eyes, something felt strangely familiar. The sunlight shining through his window looked exactly like it had on Christmas morning. His heart suddenly pounded. He sat up so fast his blankets fell to the floor. Without thinking, he raced to the living room again.
And there, under the tree, was a huge pile of brightly wrapped presents. All the colors. All the bows. All the excitement he dreamed of. Evan blinked hard, rubbing his eyes. Was yesterday a dream? Wasn’t yesterday Christmas? Was any of it real?
He didn’t know. Maybe it was a lesson. Maybe it was magic. Maybe it was his conscience showing him what he needed to see. But even if it was only a dream, he understood its message clearly. Being kind mattered. Changing mattered. The way he treated others mattered.
Evan sat down beside the mountain of presents, but before opening a single one, he whispered to himself, “I’m going to be better, dream or not.” He closed his eyes for a moment and silently thanked each kid who forgave him and allowed him to start over.
Because now he understood something important that he had been given one of the greatest gifts of all. Not a game. Not a toy. Not anything that sparkled under the tree. But the gift of getting a chance to change. And this time, Evan wasn’t going to waste it.

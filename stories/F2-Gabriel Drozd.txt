A Snow Day Upstate
A Snow Day Upstate
By Gabriel Drozd
One winter, my family and I went upstate for a few days, and it snowed like crazy. I’m not talking a little snow. There was so much snow that everything looked completely white. The trees, the rooftops, the fields, everything. It was actually kind of magical, but also a little scary because it was so deep.
It wasn’t just my family who went. My cousin and his family came too. So that meant me, my brother, my parents, my cousin, his two little sisters, and his parents. With that many people, the cabin was loud and full of energy from the moment we got there.
We had our ATVs with us, which always makes snowy trips ten times more fun. After breakfast, we had this crazy idea. Why not attach a bunch of sleds to the ATVs and pull each other across the snow? We found some rope and hooked up five sleds to one ATV. My cousin’s little sisters were freaking out in excitement, and my brother and I couldn’t stop laughing just thinking about it.
When we finally got moving, it was insane. The ATV started slow, but as soon as my dad sped up, we were flying. I mean, really flying. The sleds bounced everywhere, and people kept falling off. Every time someone hit the snow, everyone laughed so hard. Even if you wiped out, it was still fun. My cousin’s little sisters kept screaming and giggling at the same time, trying to hang on. My mom was shouting “Be careful,” but she was laughing too, so it didn’t really count as a warning.
We took turns driving and riding the sleds. My cousin dared my brother to go as fast as possible, and of course, they zoomed across the field like they were in a race. My brother fell off and landed in a huge snow pile, completely covered. He looked ridiculous, and we all lost it laughing. It was cold and messy, but we didn’t care because it was so much fun.
After a few hours, we got tired and a little hungry. We went inside the cabin to warm up. My mom had hot chocolate ready, and there were cookies everywhere. We sat by the fireplace, warming our fingers and watching the snow keep falling outside. Even while we rested, we couldn’t stop talking about all the crazy rides and wipeouts from earlier.
While we were sitting inside, my cousin started telling a story about another time he fell off a sled so hard that his hat flew across the yard. That got everyone laughing again, and even my dad jumped in with a story about when he was a kid and tried to ride a sled standing up. He said he lasted about two seconds before face-planting into the snow. My cousin’s little sisters couldn’t stop giggling at that one.
After a few minutes, we all crowded around the window. The snow was falling even harder now, and the trees looked like they were covered in powdered sugar. My brother pointed out that our tracks from earlier were almost completely gone already. It felt like the kind of snowstorm where time slows down and you forget about everything else.
My cousin said we should go back out again, and even though we were still warming up, we all agreed. Before heading out, my aunt made everyone shove hand warmers into their gloves, and my mom kept saying to zip up all the way so we wouldn’t freeze. Even with all the layers, the air outside still hit us like a cold wall when we stepped out, but we were too excited to care.
Once we were warmed up, we decided to build the biggest snowman ever. We rolled these giant snowballs across the yard, which was harder than it looked. My dad and my cousin’s dad had to push the bottom part together, while the rest of us lifted the middle and top. My cousin’s little sisters kept trying to put snow hats on the snowman, but kept falling into snow themselves, which made us laugh even more.
When it came time to give him a nose, we realized we didn’t have a carrot. That could have ruined it, but my dad had an idea. He grabbed an unopened beer bottle from the cabin and stuck it on the snowman’s face. It looked ridiculous, but that made it even better. We added a scarf my cousin’s mom found and stuck branches in for arms. By the time we were done, our snowman was huge, funny, and just a little weird.
The sun started going down, turning the sky a light orange-pink behind the clouds. Snow was still falling, but everything looked quiet and peaceful now. We went back outside for a few more ATV rides, but slowed down as it got darker. Even though we were tired and freezing, no one wanted the day to end.
Before heading inside for dinner, we stood outside and looked at the field covered in snow, our tracks from the ATVs, and our giant snowman with the beer-bottle nose. Everyone agreed it was the best day ever. My brother and I were exhausted, my cousin’s little sisters were sleepy but happy, and our parents looked tired but smiling.
That night, we sat around the fireplace again, drinking more hot chocolate and eating the last of the cookies. We kept laughing and talking about the rides, the falls, and the snowman. I kept thinking about how lucky we were to spend a day like this with family. It wasn’t about doing something fancy. It was about being together and making memories.
The snow kept falling the whole day, and every single second was fun, loud, and unforgettable. I’ll never forget flying across the snow on those sleds, wiping out, and laughing until my face hurt. And I’ll never forget the snowman with a beer bottle for a nose, standing there like it was part of the adventure. That snow day upstate wasn’t just fun. It was perfect.

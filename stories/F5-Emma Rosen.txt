Meya’s Midnight Visitor — By Emy Rosen
Meya’s Midnight Visitor
By Emy Rosen
There was once a girl named Meya. She was home alone while her parents were out of town. It was snowing hard and it was late at night. Meya was up watching Christmas movies and eating gingerbread cookies. Then she heard a knock on the door. Who would be visiting this late at night in the middle of a snow storm? She decides to ignore it. Maybe it was just the wind or fallen snow. Five minutes later she hears the knock on the door again, this time louder. Meya starts to get scared.
She decides to go check the door. She looks through the window on the door, but she cannot see anything because the snow is covering it. She shrugs and says to herself “it is just noise from the storm.” She goes and sits on the couch holding her plate of gingerbread cookies.

As she goes to bite one of the gingerbread cookies, she hears an extremely loud knock on her window that makes her drop her cookie in shock. It is not a singular knock. It is repeated loud knocking that gets faster each second. Meya screams “who is there. Stop playing games.”
No response.

Meya thinks maybe it is because she is tired, so she decides to go to bed. She turns off the TV and leaves her plate of gingerbread cookies on the coffee table. She grabs her Christmas blanket and walks toward her bedroom.

She gets into bed and just as she is about to drift off to sleep, she hears the same loud repeated knocking on her bedroom window. Meya jumps up in fear. “Who is there!” She shouts.

A small voice speaks through the glass. It is muffled, but she can hear it clearly. The voice says “Hello. Please do not scream. I really need help.”

Meya freezes. She does not know if she should scream or pretend she did not hear anything. She moves toward her window even though she does not want to. The knocking stops, but she hears breathing outside. It is soft and frosty, like a whisper of cold pressed against the glass.

She pulls the curtain back just one inch.

There is a snowman outside her window.
He has a carrot nose, black coal eyes, a scarf, and two stick arms that move like real arms. One of the stick arms is raised like he has been knocking for hours. Snow is piled on his head like messy hair.

Meya closes the curtain again and steps back. “No. No thank you. Not dealing with that tonight.”

The knocking starts again, but it is gentle this time.

The same voice says “Please. I promise I am friendly. I just need a favor. A small one.”

Meya lifts the curtain again and opens the window just enough to talk. “Why are you here. What do you want.”

The snowman smiles like he is relieved. “Hi. Sorry for the loud knocking. I have tiny stick arms and it is hard to knock quietly.”
Meya stares at him. “You are a snowman. You should not talk. Am I dreaming?”

The snowman nods like this is normal. “I hear that a lot. But I really do need your help. And no, you’re not dreaming.”

Meya sighs and is very confused. “Help with what?”

The snowman takes a deep breath. “I would like to borrow some gingerbread cookies.”

Meya blinks several times. “You bang on my doors and windows.. for cookies?!”

“Yes,” he says with complete seriousness. “It is very important for my survival.”

Meya shakes her head. “How do cookies affect your survival. You are made of snow.”

The snowman frowns. “It is complicated. You would not understand. Snowman science.”

Meya frowns. “Why did you not knock at the front door like a normal person. You know instead of banging on my windows? And if you could talk why didn’t you say something?”

“I tried,” the snowman says sadly. “My arm fell off. Then I had to find it. Then the wind blew me halfway across your yard. Then a squirrel stole my scarf. I have had a very long night.”

Meya cannot help it. She laughs. It is too ridiculous to be scary now. “Why my cookies. Why not find your own.”

The snowman leans closer. “Because the raccoons stole my candy canes. I need a new snack. Otherwise I get grumpy. And when a snowman gets grumpy he starts to wobble. And if I wobble too much I will roll into the woods, and if that happens I will be stuck there until spring.”

Meya sighs again. “Fine. I will get you some cookies.”

She goes to the living room, grabs the plate, and returns to the window. She hands him two gingerbread cookies.
The snowman gasps like she gave him treasure. “Two cookies. You are so generous. Thank you. You saved my night.”

He munches on the cookies even though she has no idea how he is doing it.

He turns to leave, but then stops. “One more thing. If you hear more knocking tonight, do not panic. It is probably my cousin. He likes to borrow scarves from strangers.”

“No way! I don’t want anymore snowmen coming to my house asking for cookies!” Meya slams the window

The snowman laughs and waddles away into the snow.

Meya closes her curtains. “This is crazy! A talking walking snowman!”

When she wakes up in the morning, she finds tiny snow footprints on the windowsill. Only one gingerbread cookie is left on the plate. Beside it is a note written in wobbly stick handwriting.

“Thank you for the cookies. You prevented a snowman disaster. If you ever need winter protection, tap twice on your window and I will come. Your Midnight Snowman” Meya decides she will never open her window at night again. But every winter she keeps an extra plate of gingerbread cookies nearby. Just in case the midnight snowman ever comes back again

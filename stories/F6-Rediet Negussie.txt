Snowy Cove Christmas Café
Snowy Cove Christmas Café
By Rediet Negussie
364 days of the year, the Snowy Cove, California is left abandoned. It isn’t the most scenic sight, and so residents in surrounding towns don’t visit. The rock is eroded, dead tree branches scattered along the coast, even the sky seems dead and stripped of color. But on December 25th… the scenery of Snowy Cove is flipped upside down!
It all started when a lonely Sir Jackie runs MIA on Christmas Eve—Jackie isn’t in the holiday spirit this year. He usually never is. Sir Jackie is an old man who lives alone. He doesn’t have a family to call his own, not even a pet cat to keep him company. It was a dagger to the heart knowing that the holidays were right around the corner, and Jackie didn’t have anyone to celebrate with.
He used to enviously watch families decorate their homes in colorful lights, move the elf on the shelf routinely, and even welcome in Christmas carolers to fill the neighborhood with song and harmony. This Christmas Eve, Jackie finds himself strolling along the mush of sand at Snowy Cove, dragging his feet ever so slowly. At the sight of a bench covered with moss, he slumps into it. He takes in the gloomy scenery, matching his mood.
Something in the corner of his eye catches his attention: a rundown shop. Snowy Cove was once a boardwalk with booming businesses along it: pizza shops, carnival prize stands, and more. The rundown shop he was looking at must’ve been a part of the boardwalk. He eyes it suspiciously, half expecting a creature to burst out and attack him.
Despite the loneliness he felt, Sir Jackie was a risk taker. He tore open the boarded doors and windows. A double glass door was revealed. He smashed the glass and stepped inside. The shop was dusty, dark, and filled with cobwebs. Faded signs hung crooked on the walls—“Taffy,” “Funnel Cakes,” “Souvenirs.”
But there was something else—a strange tingle in the air, like the crackle before snowfall. Jackie stepped deeper inside and found a tiny, rusty kitchen. A crooked faucet. A stove missing a knob. Cabinets barely clinging to their hinges. But to Jackie, it looked like possibility.
He got to work. He scrubbed the counters until they shined. He hammered old wood into shelves. He painted the walls with leftover paint. He crafted decorations from driftwood—wreaths, ornaments, even a tiny Christmas tree. He filled old soda bottles with candles, creating glowing lanterns.
When he lit them, the whole shop glowed gold. And then it happened. The sky above the cove shimmered. Snow—real snow—began to fall for the first time in nearly twenty years. The waves calmed. The air warmed. Light from the shop spilled out into the night.
People from the nearest town noticed the glow. Curiosity led them on the half-mile walk. When they arrived, they found Jackie—old, tired, hands covered in paint—standing beneath his decorations. The shop wasn’t perfect, but it was alive.
A little girl gasped, “It’s a Christmas café!” And suddenly, everyone was helping—painting, sweeping, bringing baked treats, fixing shelves. Jackie was astonished. For the first time in ages, he wasn’t alone.
By midnight, the Snowy Cove Christmas Café was born. Lanterns glowing. Music drifting. Children laughing. The loneliness that had weighed on Jackie’s heart melted like frost on a warm window.
For the first time in his life, Jackie celebrated Christmas not by watching others—but by being surrounded by people who celebrated with him. And every December 25th from that night on, the abandoned cove came alive because one lonely man decided to make something magical out of nothing.

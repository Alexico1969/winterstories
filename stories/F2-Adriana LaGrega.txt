Winter Story
Winter Story
By: Adriana LaGrega
It is the day after Thanksgiving and that means it's officially time to start decorating for Christmas. I go to the storage unit with my roommate Maddie and we take our Christmas tree and find that we have no ornaments or really any decorations at all. So I grab my keys and we make our way to the store. First I say that we should go to the thrift store since it's cheap there and we are broke college students living off of food from the canteen. We go in and get little tchotchke’s to put around the dorm, but we can’t find any ornaments, so we’re off to Hobby Lobby.
Right next to it is a Barnes & Noble, and I love reading—my roommate though, not so much. So she goes into Hobby Lobby to get ornaments and I go to check out some books. As soon as I walk in, there’s this huge table in the middle of the entrance with a photo of the cutest guy. Apparently he is a new author that was recently discovered; he’s around my age as well, so it’s quite inspiring to see such a young author. I pick up one of his books and it is a romance book about finding love during the holidays. I decide to buy the book because I’m always down for a new read.
I meet back up with Maddie in the car and we show each other what we bought. She opens the book and a letter falls out of the bottom. It’s some sort of love letter meant for the person who was going to read the book—and in this case, that’s me.
The envelope is a light brown with a heart on it and smells faintly like pine, which is weirdly festive. On the front, in neat handwriting, it says: “To the one who finds this: A winter story awaits.”
I laugh and say it’s probably a promotional thing, like a fun marketing trick from the bookstore. Maddie thinks it’s creepy.
“People don’t just leave love letters for strangers,” she insists.
“Well… apparently they do,” I say, already sliding my finger under the seal.
Inside is a single sheet of paper. The handwriting matches the front of the envelope.
“If you’re reading this, then fate  brought this letter to you.
If you’re ever curious enough, come to the Winter Village downtown at 6 p.m. Saturday. I’ll be at the ice rink wearing a red scarf.
Sometimes stories start in unexpected places.
—N.”
Maddie shrieks. “THIS IS A HALLMARK MOVIE WAITING TO HAPPEN!”
I roll my eyes, but inside, excitement bubbles like hot cocoa.
“I’m not going,” I say.
“You’re absolutely going,” she says.
Saturday arrives with the first real snow of the season. Our dorm window is icy, and the world outside looks dipped in sugar. Maddie helps me pick out an outfit while she blasts Christmas music at full volume. I eventually choose something cute but warm, jeans, a knit sweater, and a white scarf that keeps shedding fuzz everywhere.
When we drive downtown, my stomach twists with nerves.
“What if it’s a joke?” I ask.
“What if it’s not?” she fires back.
The Winter Village is already crowded. Strings of lights zigzag overhead, and the air smells like cinnamon and wood smoke. Kids are skating, people are bundled up drinking hot chocolate, and everything feels magical.
We walk toward the rink, and I scan the crowd for a red scarf. There are a few, but only one is worn by someone standing alone near the railing. And… oh my gosh.
It’s the author. The guy from the display table.
He’s real. And even cuter in person.
Maddie elbows me so hard I nearly fall into a group of kids.
“Go,” she whispers, shoving me forward.
I walk up to him, trying to act normal even though my heart is racing.
He notices me immediately. “Hi,” he says, smiling like he already knows me. “I’m Noah.”
So that’s the N.
“I’m guessing you found my letter?” he asks.
“Yeah,” I say, laughing nervously. “Is this something you do often—leave mysterious notes in books for random girls?”
He looks horrified for a second until I start laughing again.
“No, no,” he says, relaxing. “You were the only one. I saw you in the store the other day when my publisher was setting up the display. You picked up my book but put it back. I don’t know why, but I felt like I should talk to you… and then I chickened out and wrote the note instead.”
Honestly? That’s kind of adorable.
He gestures toward the ice rink.
“Do you skate?”
“Not well,” I admit.
“Perfect,” he says. “Me neither.”
We rent skates and step onto the ice. I cling to the railing immediately.
“Wow,” he laughs, “you weren’t kidding.”
“I warned you!”
He holds out his hand. “I got you.”
We stumble our way around the rink, slipping and laughing so hard my stomach hurts. Snowflakes land in his hair and melt instantly. After a while we take a break, sitting on a bench with steaming cups of hot chocolate. He tells me about writing his book during his freshman year of college, about how he never expected it to get published. I tell him about my major, my terrible cooking skills, and how Maddie and I are decorating our dorm like it's Santa’s workshop on a budget.
“So,” he says, “can I see you again? Maybe somewhere that doesn’t involve icy death traps?”
I grin. “I think I’d like that.”
When Maddie and I return to the dorm, snow still falling softly, she practically tackles me with excitement.
“SPILL EVERYTHING,” she demands.
I tell her everything—how sweet he was, how much we laughed, and how we both fell at the exact same time and nearly took out an entire row of children.”
She sighs dramatically.
“I leave you alone for ten minutes and you find a love story? I go to Hobby Lobby and get glitter stuck in my hair.”
I pick up the book from earlier and flip to the first page. Inside, I notice something I hadn’t seen before: another small note tucked into the corner.
“Every winter has a beginning. Maybe this is ours.”
—N.
I smile and place the book on my nightstand next to the tiny Christmas tree we decorated with thrifted trinkets and mismatched ornaments. For the first time all semester, the dorm feels warm. Cozy. Like home.
And maybe just maybe, this winter is the start of a story I never expected.

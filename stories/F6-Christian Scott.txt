The Christmas Crook
The Christmas Crook
Christmas Eve in New York
It was a gloomy Christmas Eve, and Benjamin, an 11-year-old boy living in New York, was stuck at home — bored and out of luck. He knew he needed to get on the nice list if he wanted presents, but judging by his behavior, he was far from it. So he thought… and thought…
“What can I do to get on the nice list before Christmas Day?”
he wondered.
After hours of thinking, he finally approached his mom with what he claimed was an innocent question.
“Hey mom, can I go to the Santa meet and greet?”
But Benjamin had a secret plan: sneak into Santa’s workshop… take out all the elves… and steal
every single present
for himself.
The Plan Begins
His mom agreed — as long as he shared the details and finished his homework. Benjamin rushed through it, and soon they arrived just in time. Santa was about to leave but made an exception for Benjamin.
While talking to Santa, Benjamin carefully examined the surroundings, noting the path Santa would take back to the North Pole.
But he realized he had a problem: he had no plan to sneak onto the sleigh.
Then inspiration struck — he’d pretend to use the bathroom, slip away, and sneak onto Santa’s sleigh before his mom noticed.
On the Sleigh
Benjamin hurried inside the building, watching Santa head toward the private parking lot. He darted behind him, spotting the sleigh just in time.
“Nice! Enough space to hide.”
He burrowed into the presents, curling himself into a ball. Santa fed the reindeer and climbed in, completely unaware of the stowaway hiding inside the gifts.
And just like that — after ten minutes — they reached the North Pole.
Inside Santa’s Workshop
The North Pole was colorful and sparkling with magic. But Benjamin wasn’t here to admire anything — he was here to rob the place.
He slipped into one of Santa’s toy sacks just before Santa dragged it into the factory. Once alone, Benjamin burst out of the bag and stared at the rows of toys — robots, puzzles, plush animals, even brand-new bikes.
Jackpot.
He shoveled toys into a giant red duffel bag and snuck back to Santa’s sleigh. Moments later, Santa climbed in — humming happily, unaware of the missing toys or the extra passenger.
They took off toward New York.
The Escape
As the sleigh swooped low over the city, Benjamin rolled off onto a snowbank, duffel bag beside him.
Cold, exhausted, but absolutely triumphant, he whispered:
“I actually did it.”
Benjamin ran home, ready for the best Christmas morning of his life.

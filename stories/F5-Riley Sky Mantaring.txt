Winter Story
Winter Story
By Riley Mantaring
A midst of wind danced through the winter night…as Christmas lights flashed so bright. There, they were waiting for Santa’s arrival once more. Trumpets blowing and carols calling. The return of Santa is so soon, but until then we will hum a festive tune. There were 3 days until Christmas!
A young boy by the name of London loved Christmas, it was always his favorite time of the year. But this year it felt different, because this year he wasn’t a kid anymore. Just 2 weeks ago he had turned 15 and his Christmas spirit hasn’t been the same since. His once awe and excitement for this beloved holiday has changed. This was a huge thing for London because every year he had partaken in numerous Christmas activities from caroling with the choir to baking cookies each night awaiting for Santa’s arrival. Ever since he had “grown up” he decided that it was best to mature and stop being “childish.”
Each house on the block was covered in bright lights and tinsel that moved a little whenever the cold winter air blew. By the time it got dark,  all the decorations lit upon and made each street glow with different colors. It was truly a jaw dropping sight to see each year. However… There was one house that didn’t have any lights or any decoration at all. And that house belonged to London. What had once been the brightest, most flashiest house in town slowly but steadily faded into another forgotten building. 
London hadn’t meant for it to happen. He told himself he was just “too old” for lights and decorations, that the magic didn’t mean anything to him anymore. His parents were busy, his friends were talking more about gifts than the season itself, and he felt like maybe Christmas was only meant for little kids now. So the boxes of lights stayed in the garage, untouched.
Still, every night when he walked home from school, he couldn’t help but stare at the glowing houses around him. The reds, blues, and greens reflected on the snow like tiny stars scattered across the ground. Kids laughed as they built lopsided snowmen running around, and families stood outside hanging last-minute strings of lights. London tried to ignore the strange feeling building in his chest like a soft tug pulling him toward something he thought he’d outgrown. 
	As hours crept and each second passed, there were already 2 days until Christmas. Then…One day.
Then, on the night before Christmas Eve, London stood by his bedroom window, feeling a pit of what felt like a black hole, watching the lights flicker across the neighborhood. That’s when he heard it, soft singing. The choir he used to be part of had gathered on the street corner right by his house. Their voices rose into the night, warm and bright, just like they did every year.
Without thinking, London slipped on his coat and stepped outside to see what’s going on. The air was cold enough to sting, but the sound wrapped around him like a cozy blanket. He saw familiar faces, friends who used to beg him to sing louder, neighbors who always complimented his angelic voice, the choir director waving the group into the next verse.
“London! Join us!” someone called. He froze. He had not sung in months. He wasn’t sure he could. But something inside him, something small and sparkly and almost forgotten nudged him forward. A tiny voice in the back of his hand enabled him to go and give it a chance. Approaching the choir, he overheard people talking about how they are so surprised that London had not decorated his house this year. 
London took a spot at the end of the group. He knew deep down this was truly where he was supposed to be right now, but he neglected those thoughts. When the next song began, he opened his mouth and began to harmonize with the choir. The first note trembled, but the second was stronger, and by the third, he was singing like he never stopped. The chill in his bones melted away, replaced with the warm, familiar glow he thought he had lost forever. When the caroling ended, the choir cheered and hugged him. London’s cheeks hurt from smiling, and for the first time in a long while, the lights around him didn’t feel childish at all. They felt magical.
Later, London ran home, heart racing, and went straight to the garage. Dusty boxes were stacked on the shelf, filled with tangled lights and glittery ornaments. London grabbed as many as he could carry and marched towards the porch.
His parents found him outside an hour later, standing in the snow, wrapping colorful lights around the porch pillars.
“Hey bud, I thought you were too old for this,” his dad teased gently.
“Maybe I was wrong,” London said, grinning as the lights flickered on. 
The house glowed bright, bold, and beautiful, just like it used to be. And for the first time that December, London felt it fully his spark for Christmas had come back, shining brighter than ever. But the night wasn’t finished with him yet. As London stepped back to admire his work, a soft gust of wind blew across the yard, sending glittering snowflakes swirling through the air like tiny shimmering dancers. The lights reflected off each one, making the whole street look like it was sprinkled with stars. London’s breath caught for just a moment. He’d seen nights like this before, but not like this, but not in a very long time. With this sense of belonging warming him from the inside out.
His parents went back inside to finish wrapping presents, leaving London outside alone with the winter night. He stood there quietly, listening to the muffled sounds of laughter floating from houses up the street. He could hear a distant bark from a neighbor’s dog, the crunch of boots as someone jogged past, and the gentle hum of the lights he had just put up, almost as if they were singing along with the world.
He wandered down the sidewalk, his steps slow and thoughtful. Each house he passed seemed brighter than he remembered, as if the whole neighborhood had been waiting for him to come back to the magic. A few neighbors waved at him through their frosted windows. Others stepped out to admire how beautiful his house looked again, complimenting him with warm, honest smiles.
Farther down the street, he saw the three kids he’d noticed before still playing in the snow. They were building a second snowman now, this one smaller, probably meant to be the first one’s friend. One of them noticed London and waved excitedly.
“Hey! Your lights look awesome!” the boy in the orange hat shouted.
London laughed and waved back. “Thanks! Your snowmen look awesome too!”
The kids giggled and hurried back to their sculpting, their tiny mitten-covered hands patting snow into shape. A familiar tug warmed London’s chest again. This was Christmas. Not the gifts, not the pressure to grow up, not the fear of seeming childish, but moments like this. Small, simple, glowing moments.
He continued down the block until he reached the corner where the choir had been earlier. Snow still showed footprints from where the group had stood, clustered together like penguins for warmth. For a second, he imagined he could still hear them singing, soft, gentle, drifting like a lullaby through the winter winds.
	He whispered the last line of the carol they sang together, feeling it settle into his heart like a promise.
When London finally returned home, his parents had left the porch light on for him, the warm yellow glow mixing with the colorful decorations he had hung. He stepped inside, stomping snow off his boots, and was immediately met with the smell of cinnamon and pine. His mother had lit the holiday candles again, just like she used to when he was little.
“You’re up late,” she said with a kind smile.
“Just walking,” London replied.
His dad peeked from the living room, wrapped in a red blanket. “The house looks incredible, kiddo. You did good.”
London felt a burst of pride. “Thanks.”
	They talked for a while about tomorrow’s plans, cookies to bake, presents to wrap, a movie they always watched on Christmas Eve but hadn’t in years. London agreed to all of it. For once, he wasn’t pretending. He genuinely wanted it.
Later, when he finally climbed into bed, he didn’t feel that pit in his stomach anymore. It had been replaced with a warm glow he couldn’t quite explain. He pulled his blanket up to his chin and gazed out the window. His house lights twinkled through the curtains. Snow drifted slowly past the glass, soft and peaceful.
He closed his eyes, imagining the morning ahead, laughter, cocoa, carols, and maybe even another snowman with the kids down the street. And maybe just maybe Santa soaring overhead, checking the glowing house that had once gone dark. London smiled to himself.
	Not as long as he remembered what it felt like right now, this warmth, this magic, this quiet joy of being part of something bright and beautiful.
	And so, as Christmas Eve began and the world outside sparkled like a dream, London whispered into the still, snowy night.
“Welcome back, Christmas.”
And Christmas, in its gentle, glowing way, whispered back.

The Catastrophic Snowday
The Catastrophic Snowday
The boy stepped out of his house for the first time to feel snow.
The boy's name is John and he is 10 years old and lives in Oklahoma.
John is a very nice kid to everyone and he has a lot of friends in Oklahoma from school. For the first time ever he will see snow because it almost never snows in Oklahoma.
So John and his friends had the most fun they ever had,  they made snow angels, made an igloo and had a snowball fight. But tomorrow it is not just a snow storm. John and everyone else can’t leave their house because there is 8 feet of snow outside! The snow is so powerful that no one can leave to go anywhere.
However, John knows a way to get outside. In his bedroom there is a secret passage that he made when he was little to his treehouse. If he could manage to get upstairs he could escape. But it was too late. The snow was so powerful that it broke down the door and the windows.
John’s parents are both working so John is home alone. He is freezing cold because all of the windows are broken and all the snow is coming into his house. He couldn’t even get upstairs to get to his bedroom because a pole fell through his roof and is blocking his stairs. John knows that if he does not get to somewhere warm soon he will die. He is very weak right now. He can't even move because he is so cold.
Then he thinks “This is not how I am going to die”. So he runs outside in the blizzard but the wind is going so fast and so much snow is hitting him that he is blinded by the snow. He is now lying down in the snow not moving. He is almost at the town square where he can go into a store.
However he cannot move anymore the frostbite all over his body makes it so he can’t walk. By now the cold is making him hallucinate, he sees a man so he crawls to that but he doesn’t really see anything it was just his imagination. By now John wants to give up because he has no strength left and he can barely move.
But below him he starts to hear ice cracking. John falls into an ice covered pipe. So he has nothing else to do but to follow that tunnel. But when he’s in this tunnel it's not in the storm so it’s surprisingly warm so he feels more comfortable. As he is laying down in the tunnel he hears it CRACK. So he moves about ten feet up when he hears that the storm broke some of the tunnel.
Now all of the tunnel starts to crack. He knows that if this tunnel comes down I will die so he starts crawling as fast as he can but the tunnel starts to collapse fast so he is not fast enough. He keeps going as fast as he can. He sees a ladder built into the side of the tunnel. So he knows what he must do. As he jumps for the ladder the whole tunnel collapses.
However it takes him a lot of strength to hold on to the latter because his hands are very slippery. But then he hears it. A man called out “Is there someone in here”. He picks John up and rescues him into a pizza shop. John slowly opened his eyes, everything around him blurry at first. He felt warmth on his face, something he hadn't felt in what felt like forever. When his vision cleared, he realized he was lying on a soft couch with several blankets on top of him. The smell of pizza dough and hot chocolate filled the air.
It was almost hard to believe he was still alive. For a moment he wondered if he was dreaming, but then he heard a voice behind him.
"You're awake, thank goodness," the man said. John turned his head and saw a tall man with a big winter coat still on, snow melting off the sleeves. The man smiled gently. "I'm Mark. I'm the one who heard you down there."
John tried to sit up, but his body was stiff and sore, like every muscle was frozen.
Mark hurried over and helped him sit. "Easy, kid. You've been through a lot,"
The wind outside roared so loudly that the windows shook. John flinched. Even though he knew he was safe, the storm still terrified him Mark walked over to a counter and got hot chocolate "Drink this. You need it."
As John sipped it, he felt the warmth spread through his chest. His hands were still shaking, but not as badly as before. "Thank you," he whispered.
Mark nodded. "When I heard the tunnel collapse, I thought maybe it was just the storm. But then I heard you yell. You're lucky you climbed that ladder when you did."
"Where... where are my parents?" John asked, panic returning to his face. "They're at work. They don't know what happened.
They don't even know I left the house." Mark sat beside him. "Phones are down.
Roads are buried. No one's getting through eight feet of snow right now. But listen, your parents are smart. They'll be safe, and when this storm settles, we'll find them.
You're not alone."
John looked around the pizza shop. A few other people had come inside too-families who couldn't get home, a couple who had almost gotten stuck outside. The whole building felt like a little island of warmth in a freezing ocean.
The hours went by slowly.John rested while Mark checked on customers, passed out blankets, and made warm food for everyone. The generator in the back hummed loudly, keeping the heat going. John’s parents got there no later than 10 minutes after. That’s the story of how John survived the 2027 Oklahoma blizzard.
The end.

Winter Story
Winter - The Problem Within Me
by Sarina Prabhudyal (Mira)
Winter arrives without a knock.
Without a warning,
Without me being able to block—
The feeling without everyone here.

Breeze cold as ice.
My heart in need to thaw,
In need of something nice.

Christmas time is supposed to be fun,
Tell me why it feels like the cat’s got my tongue?
My name is Mira.
And one thing is true 
Christmas seems to be for everyone,
Why can’t it be for me too?

This year I’ve lost a significant amount of family,
Though alhumdilliah I have the ones I need,
My still heart buffers, and bleeds

This year will never be the same,
Not with him gone.
My parents were together every Christmas,
This time I was wrong.

Winter arrives quietly though I must say,
I feel out of place in every single way.
The trees are the first to feel it,
their bare branches reaching upward.
My thin fingers tasting the cold,
remembering the weight of leaves,
that once glowed like gold.

Now they wear crowns of snow,
each flake perched so delicately
it seems afraid to fall.

Yet it does, endlessly,
a soft rain of frozen stars,
that gathers in drifts against roots,
and settles into the creases of bark,
like the monsters in the dark.

Once the snow starts to fall,
The way it once was, will be gone.
I wanted so badly to be wrong.
The sky becomes a pale canvas,
washed of color,
until even the sun
seems hesitant to shine.
Its light is thin,
a ghost of warmth,
stretching across snowfields
in long, trembling beams.
Yet even quiet sunlight
has some power.

It glitters across ice
like shattered glass,
turning each frozen branch
into a sculpture
that glows, briefly,
before a shadow claims it again.

The winter sun is me.
I try to handle the cold,
no matter the degree.
People move differently
under winter’s gaze.
Slower.
More careful.
As if the cold
makes every gesture matter.
Hands stay tucked into pockets,
faces wrapped in scarves,
but eyes lift more often
to the sky,
to the treetops,
to the drifting snow—
as though winter reminds us
to look up.
To see what is quiet
but present.
To notice the small miracles
hidden in white.

I try and try with all my might—
but it seems as if every night 
I dose off into a certain fright.

I feel so out of place,
but fitting in was never the case.
Winter is a season of remembering.
Memories return
in crisp, sudden flashes—
a warm room once filled
with laughter,
the scent of pine,
the crackle of fire, the burn of wine.
Hands held close for warmth.
Winter does not ask us
to forget warmth;
it asks us to understand it better.
To see how precious it is
by noticing
its absence.
There is loneliness in winter,
but also clarity.
There is cold,
but also a strange kind of comfort
in the way the world narrows
to what you can hold close.
The wind may howl,
but even its voice
sounds like the earth
confessing truths
that has been hidden all year.
Snow falls
and falls
and falls—
sometimes angrily,
sometimes tenderly,
sometimes as soft
as a sigh at the end of a long day. 
Each flake a brief poem,
a delicate geometry
that dissolves almost in a dismay.
Yet winter writes endlessly,
layering these tiny poems
until the world becomes a book
bound in white.

Maybe it feels taken for granted.
So it began to plant,
its feet deep into the soil.
As the world freezes over.
And we depend on our hearts for warmth.

And in the center
of this vast, patient season,
stands the human heart—
small, warm, stubborn—
it holds a vital part.

Beating against the cold.
It beats with hope,
even when the nights stretch long.
It beats with wonder,
even when the sun isn’t strong.
It beats with quiet strength,
knowing spring will return
but choosing, for now,
to honor winter
instead of treating it as a splinter. 

For what it is:
Winter is my season.
A season of stillness,
of softness,
of slow breathing,
of learning to see
with new eyes.

Learning to adapt and change is hard.
Sometimes tears prick my eyes. 
But in the end, I try to hold my head high.
In the end, its just- me, myself, and I.

Snow teaches softly.
No chalkboard,
no voice raised—
only the gentle insistence
of white.
It teaches patience
in the way it falls,
flake by flake,
never hurrying,
never questioning
its purpose.
It teaches courage,
covering the world
in cold brightness,
asking every small creature
to trust the season
and endure.
It teaches beauty—
how something as fragile
as a crystal
can reshape forests,
rooftops,
fields,
and hearts.
It teaches kindness—
blanketing even the broken places,
softening sharp edges,
giving quiet mercy
to the lonely and tired.
And when the thaw comes,
snow teaches one last lesson:
that nothing beautiful
is meant to stay forever—
but everything beautiful
leaves something behind
for us to carry.
Winter did not disappear all at once.
It loosened its grip slowly,
snow thinning into me coldly.
cold retreating into the corners of the earth.
What remained was not silence,
but understanding—
that even the longest seasons, even the falling snow, 
eventually learn how to let go.
The snow kept falling,
but it felt lighter now,
as if winter itself had softened.
Nothing was finished,
yet nothing felt unfinished.
The world breathed in the cold one last time
and waited—
certain that warmth always finds its way back.
The trees still stood bare,
the ground still white,
but something within me shifted.
Winter had taken its time teaching its lessons,
and now they rested quietly in the heart—
proof that even cold seasons
leave warmth behind.
Snow melted into the soil,
silence melted into sound,
and winter folded itself
into the spine of the year.
It did not vanish—
it became memory,
waiting patiently
to be told again.
Winter stayed long enough
to be understood,
then stepped aside—
leaving the world changed,
and ready.
The cold lingered in the air,
not as a warning
but as a reminder.
Some seasons shape us quietly,
and only after they pass
do we realize
we were never meant to rush through them.
Now my name is Mira 
And one thing is true. 
Winter may be hard but at least I know exactly what to do.

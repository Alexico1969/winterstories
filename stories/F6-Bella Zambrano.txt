Once Upon a December
Once Upon a December
By Bella Zambrano
Esmerelda is a ballet dancer in New York City. It’s finally time for ballet’s most infamous performance of all time,
The Nutcracker
. Esmeralda has always adored that show, ever since she was a little girl watching it with her mother—back before ballet consumed her life. She hadn’t seen her mom since moving to New York, after her mother deemed Esmeralda’s dreams as “not worth it.” With all that lingering in her heart, the holidays felt complicated, and she had considered skipping them entirely.
But Esmeralda doesn’t have the time or energy to unpack all of that now; she just needs to nail her audition for the iconic and demanding role of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Ironic, she thinks, that she’s named after a ballet number yet feels nothing like one. Packing up from the studio, she heads toward the train station—punctuality matters, after all.
As she arrives, a train pulls in. She boards without thinking, just as she has countless times before. But the moment the doors shut, she realizes something feels off—colder, emptier. By the time she notices, the train is already moving. When it finally stops and the doors open, she steps out into a place that is certainly not New York. Trees, snow, and a sign reading “Land of the Sweets.”
Esmeralda wonders if she’s losing her mind. The
only
place that exists is in the Nutcracker universe. Still, she has no choice but to follow the path. After an hour making her way through the snow-covered forest, she reaches a lavish palace glowing warmly against the icy landscape. Exhausted yet fueled by curiosity, she knocks. No answer. She knocks again. Still nothing. But as she walks away, the door creaks open.
Standing there is someone who looks exactly like the Nutcracker Prince.
Everything starts clicking in Esmeralda’s mind, but she pushes the thought aside. “Hello, my name is Esmeralda! I was hoping you know the way back to New York City? I’m very lost and—”
Before she can finish, he interrupts: “Please come in! I've been expecting you, Queen.”
Queen? She’s just a dancer. The only queen here is the Sugar Plum Fairy. She tries correcting him, but he insists—pointing out her crown and gown. Only then does Esmeralda realize she’s dressed in the soft pink and plum-colored robes of the Sugar Plum Fairy herself, with a delicate tiara nestled in her hair. With no other option, she decides to play along.
Inside, she enters a vast hall filled with dancers spinning in a perfect waltz—precise, fluid, almost mechanical in their beauty. She’s practiced waltzes on pointe since childhood, but never like this. The music swells, and somehow she drifts into the center of the room. All eyes are on her, waiting.
Wearing the very dress she once dreamed of, she does what she knows best—she dances. She pours every ounce of sadness, anger, hope, and longing into each movement. The room watches, stunned by her power and grace. She feels weightless, every step as natural as breathing.
As the final note echoes through the hall, applause erupts—yet suddenly she’s no longer in the palace. She’s standing on stage, mid-audition, facing a panel of judges rising to their feet in a standing ovation.
Panicked and breathless, she runs to the bathroom and stares at her reflection. Her regular audition wear is back. No crown. No gown. But the confidence remains—warm, steady, real. For the first time in months, she feels proud of herself on her own terms.
She leaves the theatre feeling lighter than snowfall, taking the train home—this time full and familiar. A month later, she gets an email from the ballet company: she won the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy.
Her rehearsals fly by. And finally, the night of the sold-out performance arrives. As she dances, she senses one pair of eyes watching more intently than any others—her mother’s.
After the show, a gentle knock on her dressing room door reveals her mom, holding a bouquet of Esmeralda’s favorite flowers: peonies. The two spend the night together in Esmeralda’s apartment, filling the room with long-lost laughter.
This winter, Esmeralda finds the world less cold. Christmas feels whole again.

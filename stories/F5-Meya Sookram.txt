A winter story
A winter story
By Meya Sookram • December 14, 2028
The snow was piling up as we finally pulled into the driveway of the old lodge we had rented for the week. When I put the car in park, the tires slid a little on the ice. For a second I thought we were going to roll backward. Everyone in the car screamed, but then we all started laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. I looked into the backseat and saw all my old friends from eighth grade squished together. It was crowded and uncomfortable, sure, but it also felt weirdly like home.
It had been years since we’d all been in the same place. Part of me worried it would feel awkward or different. But as we laughed together in the car, I felt something settle inside me, like everything was clicking back into place.
When I stepped outside, icy wind hit my face so fast my eyes watered. I pulled my hood tighter and looked at the lodge. It was a long wooden cabin with a roof piled high with snow. The porch creaked under our boots as we walked up. Warm yellow light glowed through the windows, making the whole place look like something out of a winter movie.
“Gosh, this snow is like a brick wall,” I said as more flakes stuck to my coat.
“Yeah, and it’s winning,” Jordan added, kicking snow off his boots.
Inside, the lodge was even cozier than it looked. A huge stone fireplace glowed in the middle of the room, filling the air with warmth. The place smelled like pine and old wood, with a little hint of cinnamon. For a moment, none of us said anything. We just stood there, soaking in the warmth.
Then Lila clapped her hands. “Okay! Rooms first. Then hot chocolate.”
We all rushed to grab our bags. The wooden floors creaked under our steps, and the hallways felt like a maze. I chose a room with a window that looked out into the forest. Snow drifted down slowly between the trees, like the world was moving in slow motion.
When I got back downstairs, everyone was already spread out on the couches and blankets in the living room. Noah had connected his phone to a speaker and was playing songs we used to listen to in middle school. Hearing them again felt like opening an old scrapbook you forgot you had.
“This is so weird,” Noah said, staring into the fire. “It’s like no time passed at all.”
“Maybe we just needed a snowstorm to bring us back together,” I said.
The wind rattled the windows loudly, making everyone jump. We all stared at each other for a second, then burst out laughing again.
“Storm’s getting pretty bad,” Jordan said. “We’re definitely stuck here.”
“Good,” I said quietly. “I missed you guys.”
That night we drank hot chocolate, played games, and argued about who cheated in Uno (which was obviously Jordan). The storm outside kept getting louder, like the wind was trying to talk to us. Once, the lights flickered, and we all froze. But the power came back on, and everyone pretended it was no big deal.
Around midnight, everyone went to their rooms. I stayed awake for a while, listening to the wind push against the lodge. The trees outside creaked and groaned. It felt like the whole world was covered in a blanket of white.
I pulled out my journal—the one I kept meaning to write in but always forgot about. I wrote a little about the trip and how strange it was to see everyone again. But I didn’t write about the part that scared me the most: the idea that maybe we had all changed too much.
I finally fell asleep, listening to the storm.
The next morning, the world was completely white. Snow covered everything—trees, cars, the porch, even the steps. It looked like someone had painted the whole mountain with one giant brush.
When I went to the kitchen, everyone was already there, still half-asleep and wrapped in blankets.
“You guys,” Noah said, holding up his phone. “We’re officially snowed in. The roads are closed.”
“For how long?” Lila asked.
“Couple days, maybe.”
Lila groaned dramatically. “Two days? With you people?”
Jordan threw a piece of cereal at her. “We’ll survive. But only because I’m here.”
The snow was too deep to go anywhere, so we bundled up and stepped outside just to see it. The cold hit me instantly, but the air felt fresh and clean. We tried to build a snowman, but the snow was too powdery and wouldn’t stick. Lila insisted it was “modern art.”
Inside, we cooked whatever food we found in the pantry, made more hot chocolate, and played every board game in the lodge. At some point, we even tried doing a puzzle, but half the pieces were missing, so that didn’t last long.
In the afternoon, when everyone was tired or napping, I went outside to the porch. The air was silent except for the soft sound of snow falling. It was one of those rare moments where everything feels still and calm.
Noah came out a few minutes later. “Hey. Can I join you?”
“Yeah,” I said, scooting over.
He leaned on the railing next to me. “It’s kind of nice, isn’t it? Being stuck here.”
“Yeah. It feels like… like old times.”
He nodded. “I didn’t realize how much I missed this. All of us. I guess life got busy.”
“Yeah,” I whispered. “I thought we just drifted apart.”
“I think people drift,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean the connection disappears.”
We stood there watching the snow fall. The forest looked like a giant white blanket stretching in every direction. Everything felt clean and quiet, like the world was restarting.
Later that night, the storm finally slowed down. The clouds thinned, and the moon came out—a soft, silver circle glowing above the snowy trees.
Everyone sat together around the fireplace again, wrapped in blankets. No one looked at their phones. No one talked about responsibilities or school or work. We just sat there, watching the fire and laughing at dumb jokes.
For the first time in a long time, everything felt simple.
Everything felt right.
And as I looked around at the people who had shaped my childhood, I realized something important:
Sometimes winter doesn’t take things away.
Sometimes it brings people back.

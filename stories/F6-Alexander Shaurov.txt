❄️The Icebound Night ❄️
A Winter Story
Frostpine Valley always had bad weather. Snowstorms rolled through every winter, sometimes fierce enough to bury cabins up to their windowsills. But the storm that hit tonight wasn’t just unusual, it felt wrong from the very first gust.
A winter valley under a stormy, unnatural sky.
Rowan knew it the moment he stepped outside to feed the dogs. The air had been still minutes earlier, the sky clear enough to see thousands of stars pricking through the darkness. But suddenly the temperature dropped so fast it made his breath turn to ice crystals that stung his lips. A wind rose from nowhere, a sharp, cutting howl that sent the dogs into a frenzy.
Then the earth started shaking beneath his feet.
Rowan froze. Earthquakes were rare here. The mountains were old, steady things. But the tremor rippled through the snowpack again, this time harder—strong enough to rattle the metal latch on the kennel gate.
“Easy,” Rowan murmured, though he wasn’t sure whether he said it to the dogs or to himself.
He was about to go back inside when the radio inside the cabin crackled sharply. His mother's voice rose in clipped, urgent tones talking to someone else, unaware Rowan could hear her through the half-open window.
"breach at Site 9. Something got out. I'm heading there now."
A radio crackling with tense, urgent voices.
His stomach flipped over at the words. Site 9. His mother never spoke of her work there. Classified research, she always said. "Safer if you don't know the details."
But her voice tonight wasn’t calm and scientific. It was tense. Afraid.
Before Rowan could call out to her, another blast of wind slammed into the cabin, shaking the shutters. He ran inside, but she was already pulling on her heavy parka, her jaw set.
"Mom? What breach? What's happening?"
She paused-just a second, barely enough for him to see how worried she was-then forced her voice steady.
“It’s nothing you need to follow. Stay here. Stay safe. This storm is… not normal.”
“I know,” Rowan said. “I felt the ground move.”
She stiffened. Not the answer she wanted to hear.
She opened her mouth as if to explain something, then changed her mind. “Lock the doors. Don’t go out again.”
And she was gone-driving out into a blizzard that hadn’t existed fifteen minutes earlier.
Rowan waited. Fifteen minutes turned into thirty, then an hour. The storm only got worse. The radio went silent. Every instinct told him that staying put was safe, but doing nothing while his mother was out there felt impossible.
When the next tremor shook the cabin hard enough to knock a lantern off the table, Rowan made up his mind. He saddled the dogsled, packed a small emergency kit, and slipped into the screaming white night.
A dogsled prepared outside a cabin as a blizzard worsens.
The valley had vanished.
The blizzard reduced the world to swirling snow and ghostly shadows. Trees loomed up suddenly and whipped past him as the sled dogs charged forward, their bodies low, ears pinned back. Rowan shouted encouragement through his scarf, though the wind stole most of his words away.
Then the tremors came once more—three of them, each stronger than the previous.
Then Rowan heard something else. Something heavy and deliberate.
    Footsteps.
    Not human.
Not animal.
Too big. Too slow. Too..
wrong.
The dogs whimpered, the rhythm faltering.
"Hey! Go!" Rowan urged them, snatching the reins.
But the footsteps only grew louder, closer-each one reverberating through the frost-bitten earth. Rowan hazarded a glance over his shoulder.
The storm's turmoil revealed two gigantic golden circles that sputtered to life.
Eyes.
Glowing eyes.
Golden, monstrous eyes glowing through the whiteout.
Then, a huge shape followed blurred through the snow at first, then horribly clear as it moved just close enough for Rowan to recognize its size: taller than the treeline, its limbs too long. A grotesque silhouette lumbering through the storm.
It let out a deep, guttural roar that the storm could not swallow.
The dogs bolted.
The sled jerked violently as Rowan clung to it, his heart pounding so hard he heard it over the storm. Trees splintered behind him as the creature plowed through the forest, its glowing eyes fixed on him. Branches whipped past his face; snow kickback stung his skin.
Ahead of them, over Frostpine Gorge, the old wooden bridge loomed.
“Please hold,” Rowan whispered, either to the dogs or the bridge, he wasn’t sure.
They shot across. The planks groaned. Cracked.
It reached the edge and the entire bridge buckled under its weight. In a deafening snap, the structure collapsed, carrying the beast down into the darkness of the ravine.
An ancient wooden bridge shattering as a giant creature collapses through it.
Rowan didn’t stop to look back, he didn’t even breathe until the valley was silent again except for the fading roar echoing from far below.
It wasn't until he slowed the dogs to catch their breath that the radio at his side crackled weakly.
“Rowan.. Rowan, can you hear me?”
His mother's voice.
"Mom? I'm here! Where are you?"
Static. Then her voice, tight with urgency.
“I’m in the glacier canyon. Something broke free from Site 9. Rowan, the creature chasing you, it won’t stay down for long.”
The blood ran out of Rowan's face.
“You know about it?”
“It wasn’t the only one,” she said. “The one you saw escaped first. But it woke something bigger, older, entombed in the canyon ice. Rowan, you need to stay away from here.”
“I'm not staying away from you,” he replied instantly.
“Rowan listen to me”
“No. You're stuck, and there's something out here that the storm's afraid of, too. I'm comin'.”
Silence. Not from the radio's failure, he could hear her quiet, shaking breath behind the static. She knew she couldn't stop him.
“Then be careful,” she whispered. “The ancient one, it’s beyond anything we studied. And it’s awake.”
The weight of her words hit Rowan hard as she swallowed.
The smaller creature-if something that size could be called small was still alive. Another, much larger one was roaming free. His mother was alone in a canyon where both had emerged. He looked down at his dogs, their fur thick with frost, their sides rising and falling with exhaustion. When he pointed toward the canyon’s direction, however, they waited only for his word. “Let’s go,” he said. They ran, right into the heart of the storm, toward the monsters waiting in the ice

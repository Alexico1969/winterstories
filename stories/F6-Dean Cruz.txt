Where Is The Elf?
Where Is The Elf?
A Winter Story
The first day of December, December 1, is when it starts. When the work starts. As the day happens I get prepared for the daily tradition of the North Pole. This tradition is making toys for kids across the globe, bringing happiness around the world. Though there is one problem with this yearly tradition and all the others that came before it: we don’t have any elves. Not enough to pass the work around to make toys for every kid in the world.
So we went for another option, one which would gain us the manpower needed to make all the toys. This option would be taking people around our height and making them our workers. Now, the one who is reading this may be asking why specifically people our height. Well, it is pretty simple— they are easier to take than taller people. Santa’s sack is a lot more useful in the capturing process with people our height.
Now you may think, what are the elves’ jobs in all of this if the people our height make all the toys? Well, we are the supervisors of this entire operation. After all the work, we have to wipe their memory of everything. At worst they will remember it as a dream—one that they eventually forget. People usually don’t realize they are missing because we have someone named Mariah Carey to distract them with the same song every year.
With the Christmas music and all the merch we sell, we have enough money to buy the resources needed for toys. Some regular people know about us—mainly the CIA. They let us be, probably because we bring in taxes, happiness, and help without causing any issues.
Many of you know about Saint Nicholas and how Christmas is religious. Well… we kinda made that up and slipped it into tradition. It deepened us into myth, into story, into something no one would ever consider real. It worked. People made movies about us, built a whole holiday, and never suspected the truth.
The North Pole is perfect for hiding. Almost no one comes, and no one stays long. The only risk is satellites, but the CIA covers for us. We are both hidden and connected at the same time. Over the years, we’ve expanded our workshops. To fund it, we made more songs—catchy ones. With all this money, we created business after business. Most toy companies? Secretly controlled by us.
We moved into electronic toys too: video games, battery-powered devices, nerf blasters. Choices upon choices. No one knew a thing. We didn’t need reindeer anymore; we just sold toys instead. We practically controlled most entertainment—except TV. But to avoid suspicion, we faked competition between our biggest titles. Santa planned it all. He is kind, but always calculating, always thinking ahead.
The major part of our success is secrecy. If people knew we existed, one slip-up could reveal everything. One person could tell another, which leads to suspicion, which leads to investigation, which leads to being caught. But since people don’t believe we exist, anyone who claims otherwise sounds ridiculous.
As we go through our routine of management, I wonder how far a secret group can spread. How high can we rise before someone notices? How far can we expand? It is not mine to question, because no one is going to find out. To people, Santa is just a myth. Even with proof, people would say it’s fake. So as December ends, we prepare for next December. And I wonder how we will expand this time.

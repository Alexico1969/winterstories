By Anonymous
Once upon a Christmas time there were two snowmen named Mark and Mike. The creators of Mark and Mike are sworn enemies. They are neighbors, they hate each other so they made these two snowmen that will destroy each other. Today it’s early in the morning at 5am and the owner of Mark, John, decided to do something so mischievous that it was unheard of. Mike’s owner Shane woke up and he went to check on Mike to make sure he’s okay. When he looks at Mike he loses his button. DUN DUN DUN. Shane immediately suspects that John did this and heads over to his house. He confronts John saying “How could you do this, they were supposed to have their own fight on Christmas Day.” John responds saying “ I didn’t do such a thing, I know the rules and I respect them.” Shane is so furious that he doesn’t give John a chance and pushes him to the ground and leaves. Now Shane has to go to the store and get some buttons for Mike.
As Shane storms down the driveway, crunching through the snow with every angry step, he can practically feel the Christmas spirit evaporating around him. His breath shoots out in fiery puffs, and he mutters to himself the whole way to his truck, "Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. One rule. ONE RULE."
He slams the truck door shut, turns the key, and the old engine coughs awake. The windshield wipers scrape frost away as he pulls out of the driveway. Even though the town is still half asleep, holiday lights quietly blink along the houses he passes. Inflatable Santas wobble in the wind, giant candy cane decorations glisten under the streetlamps, and the giant evergreen tree in the town square stands proudly wrapped in twinkling lights.
But Shane sees none of it. His brain is locked on the missing button.
Meanwhile, back in his yard, Mike the snowman leans slightly forward in the dim morning light —more than he should have. If anyone had been watching, they might have sworn he moved. Mark, standing in John's yard next door, also seems to be tilting in a new direction, almost as if the two snowmen are staring each other down.
John brushes snow off his jacket and stands, still baffled by Shane's accusation. He looks out at Mark, studying him carefully. "Why would he think I'd cheat?" John mutters to himself. "This is the whole point. Christmas snowman showdown. Tradition." He approaches Mark and dusts snow off his hat, checking if anything is out of place.
But something is strange.
Mark has a small indentation on his base, almost like a footprint... but smaller. Much smaller.
John squints at the snow, trying to figure out what it could be. A squirrel? A raccoon? A kid? But the shape isn't right. It's rounder. Cleaner. Almost like a tiny stamp pressed into fresh snow.
He shakes his head. "Probably nothing," he tells himsen, though a weird prickle runs down his spine.
Back on the road, Shane pulls into Frosty's Craft & Holiday Supply Store. It's barely open, lights flickering on as the employees shuffle inside. Shane strides through the doors with the single-minded determination of someone preparing for battle.
He heads straight for the "Snowman Accessories" aisle an entire section filled with buttons, scarves, hats, and even miniature broomsticks. He grabs a pack of shiny black buttons, then hesitates. No-Mike deserves better. Mike deserves the BEST.
So he grabs the deluxe button pack. Gold-rimmed. Extra glossy. "Perfect," he mutters.
What neither man knows is that the missing button didn't fall off.
It was taken.
And the thing that took it was still wandering between their yards, leaving tiny round prints and carrying a button much bigger than its head

Winter Story
A short winter tale
It all started on a Thursday afternoon when my family got into a big fight.
The chaotic living room before the storm.
It was mid-December, only a week before Christmas, and our living room looked like it had been hit by a holiday hurricane. Boxes of ornaments were tipped over and rolling across the floor, spilling glitter that clung to everything. A pine-sharp smell filled the house from the tree my dad had insisted was “the perfect one,” even though it leaned slightly to the left.
I was doing the most important job—organizing the ornaments by color. Reds in one pile, golds in another, special family ones wrapped carefully so they didn’t scratch. My brother was on the opposite side of the room, sitting cross-legged and wrestling with a giant knot of Christmas lights, mumbling as if the lights personally planned to ruin his day.
Hands sorting ornaments and tangled lights.
Mom and Dad were arguing over where to hang the stockings. My brother and I were arguing about whose turn it was to put the angel on top of the tree. It was chaos, but normal chaos. Loud chaos. Familiar chaos.
Until the electricity cut out.
Everything instantly went black. The house fell silent—not a single hum from the heater, not the gentle buzz of lights, nothing. Only our collective breathing.
Then came the “THUD.”
A sudden, heavy slam at the front door.
The front door slammed so hard the floorboards vibrated. It wasn’t the kind of slam caused by a breeze. It sounded like something had thrown its whole weight against the door. Hard.
Then the windows went white.
Snow. But not gentle falling snow—massive, suffocating piles of it pressing against the glass, swallowing the entire view of the outside world. The porch had disappeared. The driveway. The yard. Everything was buried.
Mom’s face shifted from annoyed to terrified in one second. She grabbed our arms.
“Under the table. Right now.”
Her voice was calm, but her eyes were not. I didn’t even think—my legs moved automatically. My brother, normally full of jokes, looked like he’d swallowed ice.
We dove under the big oak dining table. It had always been a sturdy, ridiculous piece of furniture—so heavy it took four adults to move it. Mom always joked that it would survive the end of the world.
Maybe that’s why she was hiding us under it.
Huddled beneath the old oak table as silence falls.
The silence after the “thud” felt wrong. The kind of silence that wasn’t natural. It pressed against my ears like the house was holding its breath.
Then we heard it.
Scrape… scrape… scrape…
Something dragged itself across the outside of the front door. Slow. Deliberate. Rhythmic. Not wind. Not snow shifting. Something testing the wood grain.
My brother whispered, “What is that?”
Mom didn’t answer. She just pressed her finger to her lips.
The scraping stopped.
For a moment I thought the fear might fade, but then a new sound rose from above us.
Tap… tap… tap…
Soft. Sharp. Like fingernails tapping glass. Or porcelain. Coming from the master bedroom—directly above the dining room.
Mom’s grip on my arm tightened. Her voice was barely a breath. “It’s on the roof. Stay still. Don’t look up.”
The tapping moved across the ceiling. Not like footsteps—something lighter, skittering, uneven. It paused right above us.
Then came a new sound: the thin, metallic squeak of the chimney damper opening.
Instantly, icy air flooded the room. The scent of pine twisted into something colder, mixed with a musty odor—like wet fur and dust from an old attic that hadn’t been opened in years.
A low gurgling noise drifted down the chimney. Not a growl. Not talking. Something in between, like a voice trying to form through a clogged throat.
My brother whimpered. Mom pulled us closer.
That was when we saw it.
A shadow leaked across the fireplace hearth. Not from a light source—there was no light. It simply appeared, stretching and curling across the floor like a living thing. It had no proper shape at first, just darkness pooling and reaching.
Then the voice came.
A whisper, brittle and raspy, like dead leaves crushed underfoot:
“I’m here for the ornaments, little keeper.”
I froze. My heartbeat felt loud enough to echo through the room.
Before I could react, the shadow lunged. A huge, obsidian-black antler scraped the underside of the table so close I felt the air shift above my head. The table trembled as something massive bumped against one of the legs. Mom wrapped her arms around us, pulling us into her sides.
Another sound followed—soft clinks. The boxes of ornaments. The creature was digging through them, glass balls rattling and rolling as it searched.
“Keeper…” it whispered again.
“Where is the one you guard?”
My stomach dropped. The creature wasn’t here for all the ornaments—it was here for one.
My grandmother’s ornament.
A tiny silver bell she had given me the year before she passed. She had called it “the guardian bell.” She said it protected our home during the darkest winter nights. I had kept it safe, wrapped in tissue at the bottom of a box.
Mom caught my eye and recognition flashed through hers. She knew what it wanted.
The shadow’s form thickened. I couldn’t see it clearly, but I could make out antlers, tall and branching like twisted tree limbs, and shoulders that hunched unnaturally. Its eyes glimmered faintly, like reflections in ice.
An impossible shadow spreads across the hearth.
The house groaned suddenly. The walls creaked like the snow outside was shifting again, pushing harder. A deep crack echoed from somewhere outside, like a giant sheet of ice splitting in half.
The creature paused.
Its head snapped toward the sound. Its antlers twitched. For the first time, it hesitated. Its shadow trembled.
Something else was outside.
And whatever it was… the creature feared it.
The wind outside changed pitch. It wasn’t a storm sound. It was deeper, resonant, almost like a distant call.
The creature recoiled from the fireplace, its shadow shrinking and curling in on itself.
Mom whispered, barely audible, “Stay down. Don’t move.”
The creature hissed, a dry sharp sound.
“This isn’t finished… little keeper.”
Then the shadow shot back into the fireplace like it had been pulled by invisible hands.
The damper clanged shut.
Silence returned.
Slowly, cautiously, Mom loosened her grip. My brother buried his face in her sweater, shaking. I stared at the fireplace, waiting for any sign the shadow would return.
It didn’t.
But something else did.
A soft, chiming ring from inside the ornament box.
The silver guardian bell.
Ringing.
On its own.
And the snow outside…
was no longer still.

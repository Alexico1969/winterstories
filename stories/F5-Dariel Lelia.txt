Albert Saves Christmas
Albert Saves Christmas
by Dariel Lelia
The snow fell softly on Christmas Eve. Little flakes covered every house on Maplewood Lane. Lights were shining, trees were glowing, and everyone felt happy. Well… almost everyone.
Inside one house lived a boy named Jorge. He was upset. He felt like no one listened to him. His brother bothered him all the time, his parents were busy, and nothing felt fun anymore. Christmas was supposed to be the best time of the year, but this year it felt wrong to him.
So Jorge made a bad choice.
He sat at the kitchen table with a big plate of cookies. They were warm and smelled like chocolate. But Jorge didn’t smile. He sprinkled a strange powder on them. It wasn’t super dangerous, but it would make someone feel weird, grumpy, and confused for a little while.
He stared at the cookies and whispered, “Let’s see Christmas stay perfect now.”
He put them out for Santa and went to bed.
Later that night, Santa flew over Maplewood Lane. His sleigh bells jingled, and his reindeer trotted on the roofs. Santa hummed a happy tune as he slid down Jorge’s chimney.
When he saw the cookies, he smiled. “Ho ho ho! Don’t mind if I do!”
He ate them. One bite. Two bites. Then Santa blinked.
“What… what is this?” he said slowly.
His smile faded. His head felt funny. His boots felt too tight. He tried to laugh, but nothing came out.
He suddenly felt annoyed. And tired. And confused.
“Why am I even giving out gifts tonight?” Santa grumbled. “Kids don’t need all these toys.”
Then, in a strange, grumpy mood, Santa did something he had never done before:
He went back to the houses he had already visited and picked the gifts back up. Bag by bag. House by house.
He stuffed the presents into the sleigh and flew away, leaving empty trees behind.
In one of those houses lived a boy named Albert.
Albert loved Christmas more than anything. He loved the lights, the warm cookies, the songs, the fun, and the magic. He even loved waking up extra early just to peek at the presents.
But tonight, he woke up by accident. He was thirsty and wanted a drink of water. As he walked past the living room, he noticed something strange.
The lights on the tree were blinking. The stockings were hanging. But the floor under the tree… was empty. No boxes. No ribbons. No wrapping paper. Nothing.
Albert rubbed his eyes. Maybe he was dreaming? He checked again. Still nothing.
His heart jumped. “Santa wouldn’t forget us,” he whispered. Something must have gone wrong. Something big.
Albert stood there and took a deep breath. Then he said quietly, “I have to fix this.”
He doubted himself. He was just a kid. But Christmas needed help, and he was the only one awake.
Albert threw on his boots, coat, scarf, and gloves. He scribbled a quick note for his parents: I’m helping Christmas. I’ll be back soon. Then he stepped outside. It was cold, very cold, but his heart felt warm with determination.
The only store open was the Dollar Tree. Its bright green sign glowed in the dark like a little lighthouse. Albert pushed through the snow until he reached it.
Inside, everything felt magical. The aisles were full of small toys, candy, puzzles, crayons, markers, and stuffed animals. They weren’t huge gifts, but they were still fun.
Albert grabbed a basket and raced through the aisles. He tossed in little toys, fun crafts, stickers, toy cars, coloring books, gloves, keychains—anything he thought a kid would like. The basket got heavier and heavier.
When he went to pay, the cashier looked at all the toys and asked, “Big Christmas morning?”
“For the whole street,” Albert said. She blinked. “The whole street?” Albert nodded. “Someone took all the gifts. I’m trying to fix it.”
The cashier stared for a moment, then smiled gently. “In that case,” she said, “this one’s on us. Go save Christmas.”
Albert’s eyes widened. “Really?” She nodded. “Merry Christmas, kid.” Albert thanked her, grabbed the bags, and hurried back home.
But he still had one more job: he had to help Santa. He wasn’t sure how, but he believed Christmas magic worked best with kindness. So Albert made a new plate of cookies. Simple sugar cookies with sprinkles. While he baked, he focused hard on good thoughts—kindness, joy, giving, and love. He hoped Santa would feel better if he ate them.
After the cookies cooled, he placed them by the tree. Then he went out into the cold again, carrying all the Dollar Tree gifts. House by house, he placed a small bag on every doorstep. His hands got cold, and his feet hurt, but he kept going. He didn’t stop until every house had a Christmas surprise waiting.
Suddenly, the sky above him sparkled. A swirl of snow glowed in the moonlight. Then—whoosh!—a sleigh came down from the sky and landed right in front of him. Santa stepped out. But this time, Santa looked normal again. His cheeks were rosy, his eyes were bright, and he looked calm—not grumpy.
“Albert?” Santa said. “Is that really you?” Albert nodded. “Santa… something went wrong.” Santa sighed. “I know. I ate some strange cookies earlier. They made me feel very mixed-up. I even took presents back.” He shook his head. “But then I tasted the cookies you left. They helped me remember what Christmas is about.”
He looked around and saw the gift bags on every porch. “Did you do all this?” Albert felt shy. “I just wanted kids to have something.” Santa chuckled. “You did more than something. You saved Christmas on this whole street.”
Santa lifted his bag and smiled. “Let’s finish the job together.” They went house to house, putting the real presents back under the trees. They added the Dollar Tree gifts as little bonuses. Santa hummed happily the whole time.
When they finished, Santa gave Albert a small wrapped box. “For bravery,” Santa said. “And for having a true Christmas heart.” Albert smiled up at him. “Merry Christmas, Santa.” “Merry Christmas, Albert!”

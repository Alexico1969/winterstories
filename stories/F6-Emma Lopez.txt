Winter mystery
by Emma Lopez
It was the coldest morning of the year when everything in my town changed. Winter had already been around for a while, but that day felt different. When I stepped outside for school, the wind hit my face so hard it almost stung, and the sky looked pale and heavy, like it was holding back something big. I remember thinking it was going to be just another boring winter day, but I was definitely wrong. Sometimes I think back on it and wonder if everything that happened would have been different if I had stayed home, but I guess that’s how these things go. You don’t know something important is coming until you’re already in the middle of it.
The first weird thing happened on the bus. Everyone was half asleep and complaining about the cold, but then the bus made this strange crunching sound when it turned the corner by Miller’s Field. It didn’t sound like normal snow. It sounded sharper, almost like glass. The bus driver slowed down, and we all leaned toward the windows to see what it was. The whole field was covered in ice, but not normal ice. It was shiny in a way that almost looked like it was glowing, like there were tiny lights underneath it. At first we thought it was just the sun, but the sky was cloudy, so that didn’t make sense. The bus driver just shook her head and kept going, but that sight stuck with me the whole morning.
When I got to school, people were already talking about it, especially the kids who lived near the field. They said the ice appeared overnight and that their dogs wouldn’t go near it. Someone joked that aliens landed there, and someone else said it was chemicals from the factory outside town. Nobody believed anything, but everyone kept talking about it because it was more interesting than the math test we had first period. I tried to focus on class, but I kept looking out the window. Snow kept falling, soft and quiet, but I could still see something shining in the distance, and I knew it had to be the same weird ice.
After lunch, the school made an announcement that the buses would be taking us home early because the storm was supposed to get worse. Everyone cheered because nobody wanted to sit through the rest of the day. When the final bell rang, the hallways exploded with noise. People were running, laughing, yelling over each other, and just excited to get out. I got on the bus with my friend Mia, and we sat in the back like always. As we were leaving the parking lot, she nudged me and pointed toward the window on the left side. The glowing ice field was closer than I thought, and from that angle, it looked even brighter than it did in the morning. Watching it made me feel weird, like I was supposed to know something about it but didn’t.
By the time we reached the field again, the snow was coming down heavier, and the sky was even darker. The driver slowed down the bus again, maybe because she remembered the sound from earlier or maybe because she was curious like the rest of us. The field looked even stranger now. The ice wasn’t smooth like normal frozen ground. It had patterns in it, like someone had carved long lines and shapes across the surface. They weren’t random either. They looked like they were forming something, but we couldn’t tell what. A couple of kids pressed their faces against the windows. One boy said it looked like writing, but nobody could read it if it was.
Then something happened that made everyone go silent. A loud crack echoed across the field, strong enough that the bus windows shook. Another crack followed, and then another, like the ice was splitting apart from the inside. The glowing part got brighter for a second, and I felt this weird chill down my spine that wasn’t from the cold. Even the bus driver looked nervous. She told everyone to stay in their seats and not panic, but her voice didn’t sound confident. For a moment, I thought the ice was going to explode or collapse or do something huge, but then everything just... stopped. No more cracks. No more glowing. Just the storm and the regular sound of snow hitting the ground.
The bus driver pulled away fast after that, and nobody said anything for the rest of the ride. When I finally got home, the first thing I did was look out my bedroom window toward the field. I couldn’t see the glowing anymore, but I knew it was still there. My mom told me to help bring in firewood since the power might go out, but the whole time I was outside, I kept looking toward the field, waiting for something else to happen.
That night, the storm got even worse. The power flickered, the wind pushed against the house like it was trying to break in, and snow piled up so fast that our porch disappeared under it. I barely slept because every sound made me jump. Around midnight, there was this deep rumbling noise, like thunder but lower. I got up and looked outside, and for a second I saw a faint glow coming from the direction of the field again. I couldn’t see the ice clearly, just the light reflecting off the falling snow. It looked gentler this time, not scary like before. Almost calm.
By morning, the storm had stopped. Everything outside was buried in thick snow, and the sky looked soft and pale. When I checked the field again from the window, the ice was completely normal. No glowing. No patterns. No cracks. It didn’t even look shiny anymore. It looked like a regular frozen field, like everything we saw might not have been real. But I know what I saw. And when I got to school later that week, I could tell from everyone else’s faces that they knew what they saw too. Nobody talked about it in class, but people whispered about it in the hallways. Some kids said it was just the storm playing tricks. Others said it was something else, something we might never understand.
Even now, whenever I walk past Miller’s Field, I look at the ground and wonder if anything like that will ever happen again. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it was something big that we just didn’t get the chance to figure out. But every winter, when the first snow starts to fall, I think about that day and the strange ice and the glowing patterns that still show up sometimes when I close my eyes. And no matter how normal things look now, part of me knows that winter in our town will never feel completely normal again.

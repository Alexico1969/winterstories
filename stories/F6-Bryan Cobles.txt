A Christmas Miracle
A Christmas Miracle
By Bryan Cobles
Snow flakes were all over James bedroom window as Christmas Eve settled over his small neighborhood. The tiny house he lived in wasn’t decorated much, just old lights that were half way lit and a paper star he had made years ago on his small tree. Still, James sat on his bed praying for a good holiday.
His family didn’t really have the money that he hoped for. His dad had lost his job, and his mom was working extra shifts at the diner just to keep the bills paid. His parents explained it to him, wishing he understood, but James knew what it meant every year. He wouldn’t be having boxes in Christmas wrapping paper waiting for him in the morning.
But he still believed that maybe something magical could happen. Maybe Santa would understand. Maybe prayers did get answered.
So before he went to sleep, James kneeled beside his bed, pressed his hands together, and said out loud, “Please… if it’s possible, can there be something under the tree? Not even something big. Just… something.”
When he tucks himself under his sheets, he tries to feel cheerful, but the quiet house made his chest hurt, Still, he shut his eyes and fell out, imagining warm lights, shiny ornaments, and a tree surrounded by gifts.
But as soon as sleep took him, something strange happened. James felt cold air brush his cheeks, way too cold to be in his bedroom. He got up quickly, rubbing his eyes. Snowflakes landed softly on his eyelashes. He gasped.
He was outside. Not at home. Not anywhere he recognized.
He stood in the middle of a huge snowy field with icy wind swirling around him. The sky was a deep, glowing blue, brighter than any night sky he’d ever seen.
James turned in a slow circle, trying not to panic. “Okay… this isn’t normal,” he said out loud. His breath floated in front of him like little clouds. He hugged his arms around himself and took a step forward through the soft snow.
Then something caught his eye, a faint trail, almost like a path, leading farther into the white landscape. James followed it. He didn’t know why, but something inside him told him he should.
After several minutes, he saw lights. bright, warm lights, glowing like lanterns in the fog. As he got closer, he heard sounds too: bells jingling, wood clattering, and cheerful voices humming tunes he couldn’t quite recognize.
Then he saw it. A massive wooden building, colorful and shining, sat at the end of the path. Candy cane poles framed the entrance. The roof sparkled with snow. Through the windows, James could see tiny figures, elves. Actual elves, working like they were getting ready for something huge.
His jaw dropped. “No way,” he whispered.
He stepped inside cautiously. The room buzzed with activity. Toys of every kind filled shelves and tables. Elves walking back and forth carrying tools, wrapping paper, ribbons, and freshly finished toys. None of them seemed surprised to see a human kid walking in. A few waved politely. One rushed past him carrying a stack of teddy bears.
James swallowed hard. “Um… excuse me? Where am I exactly?”
A deep, warm laugh echoed through the workshop.
“HO HO HO! Well now, that’s a question I don’t hear every day from a visitor.”
James spun toward the voice. There, standing tall with a red coat, long white beard, and kind eyes, was Santa Claus.
James froze. He couldn’t even find words.
Santa stepped closer, “You look a bit lost, young man.”
“I… I guess I am,” James said. “I went to sleep, and then I woke up here. I don’t know how to get home.”
Santa nodded thoughtfully. “Dreams are powerful doors, especially on Christmas Eve. Sometimes, when a heart is full of hope, it can open paths to places you wouldn’t expect.”
James shifted nervously. “Can you help me? I really need to get back.”
“Of course,” Santa replied. “But getting home from the North Pole isn’t simple. It requires courage, kindness, and a bit of the Christmas spirit.”
Santa reached into a drawer and took out a rolled-up map tied with a red ribbon. He handed it to James. “This map will guide you,” he said. “It will show you three tasks you must complete. If you finish them, the path home will appear, and when you wake up, you will find gifts under your tree.”
James held the map carefully. “Why me?”
“Because,” Santa said with a soft smile, “you asked not with greed, but with hope. And hope is magic.”
James unrolled the map. The ink shimmered like silver moonlight. Three symbols were drawn: a lantern, a star, and a heart.
“What do they mean?” James asked.
“You’ll see,” Santa said. “But remember, the tasks aren’t about the objects. They’re about what they represent.”
James nodded, feeling a spark of bravery rise in his chest. “Okay. I’ll do it.”
The first task appeared almost immediately. As he stepped outside the workshop, the map glowed and the lantern symbol lit up. A faint light blinked in the distance, like someone had dropped a tiny flame in the snow. James marched toward it and found a lantern lying half-buried. When he lifted it, the flame inside burned brighter. Suddenly, the cold around him softened. The lantern wasn’t about light—it was about hope in dark places.
The second task brought him to a tall icy hill. At the top, a small silver star sat frozen in a block of ice. He touched the ice gently. It melted instantly, warm against his fingers. The star wasn’t about climbing, it was about believing something difficult could be reached.
The third task led him to a group of small arctic animals huddled in the cold: a fox, two rabbits, and a tiny reindeer calf. They shivered helplessly. James knelt beside them, wrapped his scarf around the calf, and gathered the others close to block the wind. The map glowed fully. The heart symbol had been about kindness.
As the symbols lit up, the ground beneath him began to shine like a pathway of pure light. James felt himself rising, floating, drifting,
And then he opened his eyes.
He was back in his room. The morning sun shone through his window. He bolted upright and ran to the living room.
There, under the tree, were presents. A mountain of them. More than he had ever received in his life. Thoughtful gifts wrapped in his favorite colored wrapping paper. Enough to fill his heart completely.
His parents stood nearby, tired but smiling. “A friend dropped some things off for us last night,” his mom said. “They wouldn’t say who.”
James smiled to himself, filled with joy. He didn’t need to.
Magic had answered. And sometimes, that was more than enough…

Winter Story
Winter Story
By Marco
On a cold winter night a teenage boy named Michael was waiting for the train to come. He was sitting by himself shivering watching the train come down the track. As he entered the train he had a weird feeling, there was no one on the train, but he still had to get home. So he sat down spacing out and all of a sudden he hears the on the speaker the conductor say the train will keep looping their winter night until they choose to face the one memory they avoid. At first Michael didn’t believe it and just thought it was a joke until he looked at his phone and saw that it has been 3 hours and he has been looping around in circles. As he looked out the window he saw all of his memories from his childhood during Christmas time but there was one that stood out. It was the one of him touching his elf at night time making it lose its magic when no one was there.
Then on the speakers again a muffled voice said to end the loop you must face what you fear. The train sped forward and all he could see was that memory replaying over and over again it was trying to force him to look. Michael turned away from the window and refused to look. He opened his eyes and felt like everything was caving in on him. The train walls were tightening, coming closer and closer. It was pulling Michael closer, the speaker then again went off and repeated to leave the loop, you must face what you fear. He kept looking away and avoiding the memory until heavy snow and wind was pushing him into the memory. He grabbed on to his seat holding on for life but was sucked into the memory.
Michael opened his eyes and he was in bed laying down but something felt off. It was like he was smaller and shorter. Michael stood up and walked over to his mirror and he was shocked. He was a kid again but then he remembered what happened on the train so he creaked his door open and peaked down the stairs. There he saw his beautiful Christmas tree lighting up and switching colors. Next to it was his elf apple he stared at it he tip-toed down the stairs and went straight up to the tree and elf. He stood there in shock just admiring how beautiful everything looks, then went straight up to the elf. He slowly went to touch the elf then got a flashback. It was him again as a child and he said to the elf I know you can hear me, why don't you just move to show me your real and that you really do have magic. Then he touched the elf and it fell off the shelf, and all of a sudden he stopped zoning out.
He pulled his fingers away from the elf and realized that all he had to do was not touch the elf and prepare for Santa to come so he could go back home. So he went to the fridge, grabbed the milk, poured it into a cup then he got cookies and put it on a plate. As he was walking away he made sure to put carrots down for Santa's reindeers. Then he was about to go back upstairs when he looked at his elf one more time and said im sorry for thinking you're not real and didn't have magic, then tip-toed upstairs. He went to his room and looked out the window with snow falling and laid in bed, and closed his eyes. The train shuddered and Michael's eyes opened and fell back into his seat. He checked his phone and saw the time was 3:15 AM and only 1 minute passed by.The speaker came on one last time and said you have faced the memory that this train will now return home.
The wheels on the train slowed, and outside the windows Michael saw the memories change into snowy tracks again. The train came to a sudden stop and the doors opened. Michael stopped onto the platform as snowflakes came down he looked into the quiet and peaceful sky and took a deep breath. He felt relieved and began walking home through the winter night with no memory bothering him but finally resting behind him. As he entered his home the door creaked open and he saw his family had decorated while he was gone. The tree was lighting up, there were cookies, carrots and milk on the table. He sat down on his couch just thinking about everything that just happened to him but it was getting late and he needed to go to bed. He tip-toed up the stairs and creaked his door open, he entered his room and went to his window. He looked at the snow falling from the sky and saw a shooting star but it looked too big and long to be a shooting star. It was Santa flying with his reindeers through the sky, Michael jumped to his bed and went to sleep. Michael woke up and ran downstairs and saw a bunch of presents sitting under the tree. He ran and woke his parents up so he could open his gifts. He went back downstairs and saw the cookies, milk, and carrots all finished with a note. The note said From Santa to Michael, thank you for the delicious cookies and milk and thanks for not forgetting my reindeers. Thank you for especially taking care of my elf Merry Christmas.
He then went to the living room and opened his christmas presents and everything felt brighter and more magical. He walked over to his elf sitting perfectly on the shelf and smiled and said thank you for everything. Then Michael finally understood that deep down the train changed him and he understood that believing in magic wasn't just about elves or Santa it was to feel joy. Snow continued falling and Michael felt the true spirit of Christmas settling gently in his heart.On a cold winter night a teenage boy named Michael was waiting for the train to come.

A Solemn Snowy Christmas
A Solemn Snowy Christmas
By: Aiden Collins
The snow was particularly harsh that dark December’s eve, and the cold bit harder than usual, gnawing through coats and gloves like an unwelcome warning. As snow thickened into sheets of ice across the bustling city of New York, crowds hurried between glowing shop windows, muttering the same caution to one another: “Watch out—this season brings strange things.” Yet no one truly knew what they were warning each other about. No one sensed how close a threat hovered above their heads.
One man, however, did. Agent J of the City Investigation Agency for the People (C.I.A.P) had spent the last few weeks chasing reports unlike any he’d seen. Several scenes had been discovered—quiet corners of the city where people had turned up lifeless under unsettling and unexplained circumstances. Each scene carried a chilling atmosphere: disturbances that suggested panic, signs of struggle, or odd, unnatural arrangements. It felt theatrical, intentional, as if someone wanted the city to witness something dreadful.
What bothered J most was how visible these scenes were. Whoever was behind them wasn’t hiding. It was almost as if the culprit wanted to perform—wanted an audience trembling at every possibility of being next. The police were too overwhelmed to help. After a disastrous mob bust left the force crippled, New York’s authority had thinned to a whisper. Petty crime had surged like a rising tide. But J wasn’t concerned about petty thieves. He was after something far worse—someone who had slipped beyond the reach of reason.
And yet J had nothing concrete. No profile, no pattern he could trust—just a trail of fear scattered across the snow.
One fateful day, that changed.
A witness, shaking and pale, insisted he saw the culprit. “I’ve never seen someone—something—like that,” the man whispered. “His grin wasn’t right. I prayed it was a mask… but it wasn’t. He grabbed a man and disappeared into the shadows like he wasn’t fully there. I backed away—I knew if I got closer, I’d vanish too.”
He described a tall figure, unusually pale, and something else—something the man struggled to put into words. J dismissed the idea of anything supernatural, as always. He believed in tangible causes, real humans behind real actions. But the witness’ trembling planted a small, irritating seed of doubt.
Still, an idea nudged him. The alley. Revisit the scene.
So he traveled from his Yorkville office to SoHo. The train ran slow, weighed down by the snowfall. On the empty platform, he stood alone—except for his reflection in the window of a darkened train car across the way. Then the Q train arrived with a blinding rush of light. He felt a force—a push—just enough to make his footing waver. Instinctively, he reached out and grabbed onto someone beside him. But the person vanished the moment he blinked.
He shook off the confusion and boarded the train, now filled with uneasy questions.
Upon reaching SoHo, the streets fluctuated between lively and abandoned. In a narrow back alley, white snow had been disturbed—scuffed, dragged through, discolored in irregular patches that deepened the further he walked. He followed the interrupted pattern until it ended at a wall.
Above, lodged near a fire escape, hung a figure—still, cold, and suspended in an eerie, unnatural way. J’s breath froze. The sight wasn’t graphic, but deeply unsettling, as though the scene had been arranged by someone who understood how to provoke dread without needing to show anything outright.
Something caught his attention: a bright blue envelope tucked near the figure. His favorite color.
Inside read:
“To: Jeremy Fitzpatrick; From: Your favorite snowy psycho.”
His blood chilled. No one knew his name. And that nickname—the one he’d only ever muttered to himself—wasn’t public.
“Listen buddy,” the note continued, “I’m disappointed you couldn’t figure it out. Thought it’d be obvious. Ever wonder why you were the only one looking for me? Go a bit more east in SoHo—maybe your memory needs a little jog… or a shove.”
Still, J followed the address listed. Snow whipped across his face as he approached the building. Strangely, pedestrians avoided the block entirely. His unease grew.
Inside, everything was dark. When the door slammed behind him, lights flickered overhead.
“Hello there,” a voice murmured from the shadows.
J tried to speak, tried to reason.
“You don’t get to yet,” the voice answered. “But you will.”
The lights flickered again—and the figure before him came into view.
It was him.
“Behold, J,” the figure said with a grin too familiar. “The answer to your chase. Who’s the Christmas-time killer you’re after? The answer: You.”
J staggered.
“You think too much,” the figure continued. “All you need to know is that it was you—not me. Or maybe… both of us.”
Panicked, J fired his gun. But the bullet struck a mirror instead, creating a fractured web of reflections. A shard recoiled, and pain tore through his side.
“You can’t escape who you are, J,” the voice murmured—inside his head now.
He stumbled out into the snow, clutching his wound. His fingers went numb as he reached for his gun again.
“J,” the voice whispered gently, “you let me in once. I can help you again. But only if you say so. Otherwise? You’ll fade out here alone. Cold. Tired. Forgotten. Tell me I can come in, and we’ll have some… fun.”
J stared into the swirling frost around him. Then he felt the words leave his mouth—words that weren’t entirely his.
“Hohoho indeed, my friend. You are the greatest Christmas gift of all… we are going to have lots of fun together.”

The first snow of the year drifted into Maple Glen like someone dumped a giant bag of powdered sugar over the whole town, and the air felt so cold that even the streetlights looked like they were shivering. Everyone kept saying winter came early, but I did not care, because snow means snowball season, and snowball season means the Snowball Ninjas show up again. Nobody knows who they are, and honestly nobody even knows if they are real, but every year weird stuff happens as soon as the first snow hits the sidewalks. I used to think it was just older kids messing around, but after last winter, I am not so sure anymore.
A quiet street in a town covered with fresh snow.
It all started on a Saturday morning, when I woke up and looked out my window and saw perfect white snow covering everything, even the basketball hoop in our driveway. I rushed outside wearing only one glove, because I could not find the other one, and my hands were freezing before I even made a single snowball. When I bent down to scoop up snow, I saw a message written across our front steps, made out of tiny snowballs lined up in a row like little frosty pearls, and the message said Beware the quiet ones. I called for my sister, but she was already halfway down the street, slipping around like a baby deer on ice.
By afternoon the whole neighborhood was outside, and everybody was acting like they had been cooped up for a year. Kids made forts in every yard, and dogs kept diving face first into snowbanks for no reason, and my friend Mason decided to climb the oak tree even though the branches looked like they could crack apart if you stared at them too hard. The weird thing was that no matter where we went, we kept finding those tiny perfectly shaped snowballs scattered around like someone had been setting them up hours before the storm even started. The older kids said it was a prank, but they also looked nervous, which made me nervous too.
Tiny, perfectly rolled snowballs arranged like little marks in the snow.
That night, the temperature dropped so fast that every window in my house fogged over, and I had to wipe a circle on the glass just to see outside. I was about to shut the curtains when I spotted something move across the yard, something small and fast, like a shadow sliding under the porch light and then disappearing behind a snow drift. I pressed my face to the glass and held my breath, and then I noticed footprints, but they were not footprints exactly, they looked more like little swooshes, like someone was jumping from spot to spot without ever fully landing. I wanted to wake my parents, but they never believe me about anything.
The next morning half the neighborhood kids met up at the bus stop even though it was Sunday, because we wanted to check out the school yard, since everyone said the Snowball Ninjas always leave their biggest tricks there. Sure enough, as soon as we arrived, we saw it, a perfect circle stamped into the snow behind the swings, and in the center of the circle there was a single snowball sitting on top of a stick, almost like it was guarding something. When Mason tried to pick it up, a snowball flew out of nowhere and hit him right in the back of the head, and we all spun around, but nobody was there, just wind and empty air.
A mysterious circle in the snow with a single snowball at its center.
After that we started searching for clues, which was kind of dumb because none of us actually knew what to look for, but it felt like something was happening, something big, and we did not want to miss it. We searched the baseball field, the old brick wall behind the gym, and even the woods at the edge of the hill, and everywhere we went we kept finding those tiny snowballs, always arranged in lines or spirals or little arrow shapes pointing toward nothing. At one point my sister said maybe the Snowball Ninjas were trying to warn us about something, but Mason said maybe they were challenging us, and honestly I did not know which idea freaked me out more.
Later that afternoon clouds rolled in again, thick and heavy, and the sky looked bruised and angry. The wind picked up and started knocking hats off kids heads, and most people went home, but I stayed out with Mason and my sister because the footprints, or swoosh prints, or whatever they were, kept getting clearer the deeper we went into the woods. We followed them until the trees thinned out and we reached the old sledding hill, which everybody avoided after the big ice accident two winters ago. At the very top of the hill was a snow fort, but not like a normal kid fort, this one was tall and smooth and shaped like a dome, with a tunnel entrance carved out like something from a movie.
A smooth dome-shaped snow fort perched on the old sledding hill.
We crawled inside even though I was shaking so hard my teeth clacked, and the inside was bigger than it looked, with tiny snowballs arranged all over the floor in patterns that looked almost like writing. My sister said maybe it was a code, and Mason said maybe it was a map, and I said maybe we should leave, but before we could move, we heard a soft thump outside the dome, then another, then another. The sound reminded me of someone packing snowballs really fast, faster than any kid could move. I held my breath, and the whole dome seemed to vibrate as if something was circling it.
After what felt like forever the noises stopped, and when we crawled back outside, the sky had darkened to almost purple, and the wind had calmed down like nothing weird had happened at all. But the hill was different. All around the dome were fresh snowballs, thousands of them, covering the slope from top to bottom, each one identical, each one placed exactly the same distance apart. It looked like an army waiting for orders, and for a second I felt a tingle at the back of my neck like someone was standing behind me, watching.
We ran home after that, slipping and falling the whole way, and when I told my parents what we saw, they just nodded and said kids have big imaginations in winter. But later that night I looked out the window again, and I saw three shadows moving across the yard, small and fast and silent, and one of them turned its head like it knew I was watching. Then it tossed a snowball straight up into the air, caught it, and disappeared into the trees.
Three small shadows moving silently across a snowy yard beneath a porch light.
Now every time snow starts falling, I wait, because I know they are out there. The Snowball Ninjas. The quiet ones. And this winter, I think they want us to follow them again.

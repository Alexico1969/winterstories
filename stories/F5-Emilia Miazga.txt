It was the morning of December 1st, this was a very important date for everyone. On this day everyone has to go to the center of the town where the giant Christmas tree stands, and they have to hang a little paper with a wish on it. This tree was found a long time ago by a man named Alexis and he found out it is magical and can make your wishes come true. It’s a tradition that’s been going on for over 100 years. It is said that whatever wish you write on the paper is supposed to come true.
The giant town tree, lights faint through the winter morning fog.
For all these years everyone has hung a paper except Natalia because she never believed it would actually come true. But, this year was different, Natalia decided to try just this once to test it out. So she got up early and took out her ribbon and paper and began to write. Natalia’s best friend had just moved away and she just joined a new school since she is starting high school so she was all alone. So she decided to write down ,”I wish everything can go back just the way it was”. Then she folded the paper, punched a hole in it and tied a ribbon on. Natalia and her brother made their way over to the Christmas tree and chose a perfect spot for their wishes. She notices that many of her classmates are also hanging wishes. She walks over and they were all discussing what they were wishing for. Mark wished that he had more courage, Elizabeth wished that it snows so they can have a snow day in school, and finally, her brother wished that more people would notice him.
Children tying small papers and ribbons to tree branches, breath visible in the cold air.
The following week everyone went back to school and everything was normal. Everyday Natalia walks past the giant Christmas tree on the way home just to look at it because her favorite holiday was Christmas. But, one day as she was passing the tree she started to notice that 4 of the branches were frozen over and flashing with light. She walked up to it and looked at the wishes, and those were the exact wishes her and her classmates have hung. She was worried at first but eventually thought nothing of it.
That was until one morning, December 10th, Mark was in class and the teacher was asking for volunteers to present a project, but Mark never finished it. All of a sudden his hand went up in the air. It’s like someone put it up for him. And he couldn’t put it back down. SO the teacher finally callled on him and he walked up in front of the class and just stood their he couldn’t move and everyone started laughing at him. After about 2 minutes he as finally able to tell the teacher that he didn’t do it. He sat back down and was really confused and he was really embarrassed, everyone was talking  about it for days. It was almost like his wish came true but in the wrong way.

It started snowing and it was said that there will be 4 inches of snow. Elizabeth was very happy because anything over 3 inches of snow meant a snow day for school. Later Elizabeth called Natalia and told her right away ,”MY WISH CAME TRUE!!!”. Natalia realized that maybe these wishes actually did come true because in her town the most snow they ever got was 3 inches and that was 2 years ago. Last year it snowed but then the rain washed it away right after.
The next morning Natalia woke up to her mom barging into her room and rushing Natalia to come downstairs. So she got up and and looked outside the window and she couldn’t believe her eyes. The snow was taller than her dad. You couldn’t even walk out of the house. At first everyone was happy and surprised because they wouldn’t have to go anywhere for a few days and they can just watch Christmas movies all day. However, shortly it became very cold inside and not even blankets could warm them up. And they didn’t have wood for the fire place. Natalia ran upstairs and called her classmates immediately. They all came up with a plan and decided to try digging a small tunnel because they all only lived about a block apart. After 6 hours of shoveling with her brother their tunnels all connected.
Snow piled higher than rooftops, neighbors digging narrow tunnels between houses.
They all crawled through the tunnel until they met in the middle. Everyone was freezing, and their faces were red from the cold, but at least they were together. Natalia looked around at her classmates, and they all knew what she was thinking without her even saying it. “The wishes… they’re getting out of control.” Elizabeth hugged her arms. “I just wanted a day off school… not a giant snow mountain blocking the whole town!”Mark nodded. “And I wished for courage, but I didn’t want to embarrass myself in front of everyone.”
Natalia’s brother spoke up. “And I wished people would notice me. But now everyone keeps staring at me like I’m some kind of celebrity or something. It’s getting weird.” Natalia swallowed hard. She didn’t want to admit her wish, but she knew she had to. “My wish was… I wanted everything to go back to how it used to be. Before high school and before my best friend moved.” She looked down at her boots. “But I didn’t want any of this.”
They all decided to crawl further through the tunnel until they reached the town center. When they popped out into the open, the giant Christmas tree didn’t even look like a tree anymore. It was covered in ice, glowing from the inside like it was alive and trying to breathe. Four branches—one for each of their wishes—were frozen solid and shaking.
Elizabeth stepped back. “Okay… that’s kinda scary.” Natalia felt a tug in her chest. Something told her that the tree wasn’t trying to hurt them. It was just overwhelmed. So many wishes, all pulling in different directions. And her wish—going back to the past—was the strongest one of all. She walked slowly toward the glowing branches.
“What are you doing?” Mark whispered. “I think… I think we have to take our wishes back,” she said. “Not rip them off. Just understand what we really wanted.” Nobody really understood, but they trusted her. First, Mark stepped forward. His ribbon was shaking the most.
“I wished for courage,” he said softly, “but I don’t want it forced on me. I want to earn it myself.” The ice around his branch cracked, then melted into a tiny swirl of sparkles that drifted away. Next was Elizabeth.
“I wished for snow, but not for everyone to get stuck and cold. I just wanted something fun… not dangerous.” Her branch softened and the glow faded. Natalia’s brother took a deep breath.
“I wished people would notice me, but I don’t need everyone staring. I just wanted to feel important.” His ribbon gently floated down into his hands.Finally, Natalia stepped forward. Her ribbon glowed brighter than all the others.
She took a deep breath. “I wished everything would go back to the way it was. But… I think I was just scared of changing and being alone. I don’t want to go backwards anymore. I want to move forward.” As soon as she said it, the ice on her branch cracked like glass and then burst into a soft wave of warm light. The entire tree shook once, like it was sighing with relief.
The glowing tree releasing a gentle wave of light as ice melts and wishes calm.
Then, slowly, the blizzard around them began to lighten. The giant snow piles shrank. A warm breeze—strange for winter but comforting—blew across the town. Within minutes, the snow lowered to a normal amount, and the streets reappeared. Everything felt calm. Elizabeth looked around. “You did it, Natalia.”
Natalia shook her head. “We all did.”They walked back to their houses, this time easily and without tunnels. When Natalia reached her home, the heater was working again, her parents were relieved, and everything felt… peaceful.
That night, Natalia and her friends stood around the Christmas tree singing Christmas songs.  She didn’t know if she would make another wish next year, but she knew one thing for sure:
She didn’t need everything to be like the past. She was ready to see what the future would bring. And for the first time that winter, she didn’t feel alone at all.

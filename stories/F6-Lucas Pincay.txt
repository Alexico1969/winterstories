The Storm of Christmas Eve
The Storm Christmas Eve
A Winter Short Story by Lucas Pincay
The kitchen was warm, and the clock showed 3:15 PM. Ben, who was in his mid-thirties and always believed he was right, put on his thick gloves. His wife, Sarah, was stirring a pot on the stove.
“Dinner is at six, Ben,” Sarah said without looking up. “The tree must be up by five-thirty. Don't be late.”
“I’ll be back by four-fifteen. It’s an easy job,” Ben promised, ignoring his son Sylvester and daughter Lily, who were setting out ornaments.
Just then, the radio blared a serious weather warning: “Major, fast blizzard coming around four-thirty PM. Near zero visibility. Extremely dangerous. Do NOT go out into the woods.”
Sarah looked up, worried. “Ben, use the fake tree. It’s too late.”
Ben laughed. “That guy is always wrong. I’m going out and not leaving until I find the perfect one.” Ignoring her sigh, he grabbed his axe and left the house.
Ben drove deep past the usual cutting spot. He needed the best tree—the one that would impress everyone. He took his truck onto a rough, snowy path. At 4:10 PM, he found it: a huge, perfect Douglas fir. Cutting it down took longer than he expected, and dragging it was even harder.
Then the storm came. The wind hit him instantly. The sky turned into a terrifying, solid white. Snow blasted in every direction, erasing the world around him. Ben dropped his rope in panic. His truck was less than thirty steps away—but he couldn’t see it. He couldn’t see anything. One wrong turn, and he lost all sense of direction.
He tried following his boot prints, but they vanished under fresh snow in seconds. Walking downhill too fast, he nearly fell into a hidden frozen bed of ice. The shock fueled a surge of panic. He staggered backward, breath ragged and painful, sweat freezing instantly against his skin.
He checked his pockets: half a thermos of lukewarm coffee, his dead phone, and one granola bar. He took a sip of coffee, but it barely helped. His hands were turning stiff and numb. He realized he was walking in circles when he spotted the same crooked pine tree twice.
Exhaustion pulled at his limbs. Kneeling in the snow, he thought of Sylvester and Lily waiting at home. The idea of them waking up on Christmas morning without him hurt more than the cold. He forced himself to stand, moving only by willpower.
The Shadow of Shelter
Just as his legs felt ready to collapse, he saw a faint square shape through the swirling white. He stumbled toward it—a tiny, old forest service cabin. Boarded-up, locked, unused.
Using the head of his frozen axe, he smashed a window frame and squeezed through. Inside, the air was freezing but still calmer than the storm outside. He needed fire. Now.
With shaking hands, he used twigs and the granola wrapper to spark a flame. Finally, the fire caught, and he leaned close, tears of relief mixing with smoke.
Dawn and Reflection
Hours later, Ben woke to the sound of a snowmobile. His family and local rescuers had been searching all night. They found him shivering but alive, wrapping him in warm blankets.
The rescuers spotted the huge, beautiful tree he had cut, half-buried nearby. They helped load it onto the sled.
Ben arrived home just as the sun rose on Christmas morning. Sarah hugged him tightly, Sylvester and Lily crying and laughing as they clung to him.
As Ben helped set up the perfect tree, he didn’t complain. He was quietly grateful for every moment. The dangerous adventure wasn’t about the tree—it was about realizing how close he came to losing the people he loved most.

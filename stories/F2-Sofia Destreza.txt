Snowed In
Snowed In
The cabin key was heavier than Emma expected, cold metal biting into her palm as she fumbled with the lock. Three hours ago she'd been turning in her last final exam, and now she was here—somewhere in the White Mountains where her phone had lost signal twenty miles back. The door finally gave way with a groan, and Emma stepped inside. Then she heard it: footsteps on the floor above her head, and voices. Someone was already here.
A man appeared at the top of the staircase, mid-thirties, with an easy outdoorsy smile. "Oh, hey there. You must be with the owner's family?"
Emma's grip tightened on her duffel. "I booked this cabin. For the week."
His smile faltered. "That's weird. So did we."
An older woman appeared behind him, steel-gray hair pulled back neatly. "There must be some mistake. I've been coming here for fifteen years."
"I have a confirmation email," a younger voice called from the living room. A person with purple hair waved their phone. "Posted about it three days ago."
"This is fantastic." A fifth person—expensive wool coat, leather briefcase—had come through the back door. "I'm supposed to share a two-bedroom cabin with whoever you people are?"
The wind chose that moment to howl, rattling the windows. Through the open door, Emma saw snow beginning to fall in heavy, wind-driven sheets.
"Everyone calm down. I'm Derek." The outdoorsy man held up his hands. "Obviously something got mixed up, but that storm's getting worse. Let's stay tonight, figure this out in the morning."
The businessman—James—picked up his briefcase protectively. "Fine. But I'm calling the property company first thing tomorrow."

They shared an awkward dinner of pantry pasta. Sam, the travel blogger, tried to lighten the mood despite James's glares at their camera. "So what brings everyone up here?"
"Privacy," James said flatly.
"Just needed quiet after finals," Emma offered.
Iris, the older woman, set down her fork. "My husband Richard passed two months ago. This was our special place. I wanted to feel close to him."
"Wait," Emma said, "you don't own it?"
"We rented it every year. Same week. The owners said I could always come back."

Later, lying awake in the downstairs bedroom while Sam slept across from her, Emma listened to the storm. Something was wrong. Five people, same cabin, same week?
Through the walls, she heard Derek and James talking in low voices. She crept to the door.
"—need to tell them," Derek was saying.
"Tell them what? That you—"
"It wasn't supposed to happen like this. There weren't supposed to be this many."
Emma's heart hammered. She didn't sleep that night.
Morning brought no relief. Snow was piled three feet high against the windows.
"We need to ration the food," Iris announced. "Three days if we're careful."
"Three days?" Emma's stomach dropped.
Derek looked haggard. "Radio says once-in-a-decade storm. Could be a week before roads are clear."
"A week?" Sam's cheerfulness had dimmed. "My phone's almost dead."
James paced by the window obsessively. "I have a meeting Friday. Very important. I can't miss it."
"None of us can leave," Derek said.
Emma wrapped her hands around her lukewarm coffee. "Someone has to know we're here. Don't you all have people who'll worry?"
The silence was deafening.

"I live alone," Sam admitted. "No one would actually check on me."
"My daughter thinks I'm at a spa," Iris said quietly.
"My roommate thinks I wanted to be alone," Emma said.
Derek rubbed his face. "My partner's in Singapore. Different time zones."
"So we're on our own," Sam said. "This is starting to feel like a horror movie."

The day dragged on with cards and old magazines. But Emma kept watching.
Derek knew which floorboards creaked. Iris's grief ebbed and flowed strangely. James never let his briefcase out of sight—and it had initials stamped on the leather: R.K. Sam's camera seemed to document unusual details of the cabin itself.

That evening over rationed soup, the truth began to crack.
"This cabin," Iris said suddenly. "You said you were familiar with it, Derek?"
"I've skied past—"
"You're lying." Her voice was steel. "You went straight to the breaker box without looking. You knew where the medical supplies were. You know this place."

Derek froze.
"Actually," Sam said slowly, pulling out their phone. "I found something upstairs." They showed a photo: a framed picture of a family standing in front of the cabin. The teenage boy was unmistakably a young Derek.
"Want to explain that?" James asked coldly.

Derek set down his spoon carefully. The friendly mask cracked.
"This was my family's cabin. My parents built it thirty years ago." His voice broke. "We lost it. My dad got cancer. Medical bills buried us. The bank foreclosed five years ago."
"So you what?" James stood. "Lured us all here? Some revenge scheme?"
"No!" Derek's face went pale. "I just—I wanted to see it again. I thought I'd have it to myself. I booked it legitimately."
"Under what name?" Iris demanded.

Derek hesitated. "Richard Kowalski. I used a fake ID."
Iris went white. "That's my husband's name."
"I know," Derek whispered. "I found his obituary. He used to rent this place from my parents. I thought—I thought using his name would work, like the owners would—" He covered his face. "I'm sorry. I was stupid and desperate and I just wanted one last weekend here before they sell it to developers next month."

"Wait." Emma stood slowly. "R.K. Richard Kowalski." She turned to James. "Those are the initials on your briefcase."
James's jaw clenched. He looked at Iris, then at the briefcase, then back. Finally, he opened it.
Inside were documents. Property deeds. Financial records.
"I'm the developer," he said quietly. "I'm buying this place. Tearing it down. Building luxury condos." He looked at Iris. "When I researched the property history, I found your husband's name all over the rental records. You were here every December for fifteen years."
"You came to see what you're destroying," Iris said, her voice hollow.
James nodded. "I wanted to understand why he loved it so much. Your husband. He wrote letters to my company, begging us not to buy it. I wanted to see it through his eyes before—" He stopped.
"Before you erase it," Derek finished bitterly.

Sam lowered their camera. "I'm not really a travel blogger. Well, I am, but that's not why I'm here." They took a breath. "Richard Kowalski was my grandfather. I never met him—my dad and him were estranged. But when he died, my dad finally told me about this place. About how much it meant to Grandpa. I came to make a documentary about it. Something to remember him by."

Everyone turned to Emma.
"I don't have some dramatic connection," she said defensively. "I really did just book this randomly for winter break. I needed quiet." But even as she said it, something nagged at her. She pulled out her phone, scrolling through her dead battery's last cached pages. "Wait. The listing. It said something about the cabin being sold soon, one last chance to stay here. That's why I picked it. It felt... meaningful somehow."

"So we're all here because of the same dead man," James said slowly. "And the same dying place."

The wind howled. The fire crackled. Five strangers sat in silence, connected by invisible threads to a cabin that was already slipping into memory.

"The owners," Iris said suddenly. "Did any of you actually confirm the booking with them?"
One by one, they shook their heads.
"I got an automated email," Derek said.
"Same," said Sam.
"Mine too," Emma confirmed.

James pulled out his phone, scrolling back through messages. "The purchase was supposed to close December 15th. Three days ago." He looked up. "Legally, I already own this property. I didn't book it. I have keys because I'm the owner."
"Then who sent the confirmation emails?" Sam asked.

They all looked at each other. No one had an answer.

Derek stood and walked to the fireplace, where a framed photo sat on the mantel. He picked it up carefully. It showed an older couple, bundled in winter coats, standing on this very porch. The woman was unmistakably a younger Iris. The man beside her was smiling, his arm around her shoulders.

"He brought us here," Derek said softly. "Somehow, Richard brought us all here."
"That's impossible," James said, but his voice lacked conviction.
"Is it?" Iris stood, taking the photo from Derek. She traced her husband's face with one finger. "He always said this place was magic. That it brought people together when they needed each other most." She looked around at them all. "Maybe it still does."

The storm raged on through the night, but inside, something had shifted. They talked. Really talked. Derek told stories about growing up here, summers swimming in the creek, winters making snow angels. Iris shared memories of Richard teaching her to ice fish on the frozen lake. Sam showed footage they'd filmed earlier, the cabin captured in golden afternoon light that made it look timeless. James admitted he'd been having doubts about the development, about what he was destroying for profit.

And Emma, who'd come seeking solitude, found something better in the company of strangers bound by grief and love for the same small place.

When the storm finally broke three days later and the snowplows came through, they stood together on the porch, looking out at the transformed landscape.
"So what now?" Sam asked.

James was quiet for a long moment. Then he pulled out his phone. "I'm calling my investors. Telling them the deal's off."
"You can't afford that," Derek said.
"No," James agreed. "But I can't afford to be the person who erases this either."

"We could buy it together," Iris suggested. "Keep it as it is. Make it available to people who need what we needed."
"A sanctuary," Emma said softly.

They looked at each other, these five strangers who'd been brought together by a dead man's love for a cabin in the mountains, and they nodded.

The snow crunched under their feet as they walked back inside, already planning, already dreaming. Outside, the wind whispered through the pines, carrying the sound of something that might have been laughter—or might have been Richard Kowalski, finally at peace.

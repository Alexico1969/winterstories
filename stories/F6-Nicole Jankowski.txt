A Christmas Eve eve
A Christmas Eve eve
By the Author
Snow had started falling sometime before I woke up,the snowflakes falling down from the sky and icicles starting to form from the cold. By the time the first bus pulled up to my school, a thin white blanket had already covered the playground, smoothing over the swings and making the whole school look like something we were talking about in English class from one of the storybooks.
Inside of school, the halls buzzed with a special kind of energy, the kind that only appears once a year, on the day before Christmas break. Backpacks were heavier with wrapped gifts for classmates, lighter with homework no one planned to look at until January. The air smelled faintly of crayons, construction paper, and the sugar cookies the cafeteria ladies baked every December 23rd.
My friend Marco, walked toward his classroom slowly, savoring everything. He knew that when he came back from break, the holiday bulletin boards would be gone, and the paper snowflakes taped to the ceiling would be replaced by something less magical, maybe penguins, maybe New Year’s fireworks but it wouldn’t be the same. He wanted to hold on to this feeling of Christmas, the feeling of warmth in his heart.
In Room 12, the windows were fogged from the heaters working overtime. A garland of mismatched paper ornaments, each made by a student, hung across the whiteboard. Marco found his the lopsided one he glued glitter onto way too still holding its place proudly at the end.
“Morning, everyone!” Mrs. Alder our teacher called out, wearing her annual sweater with a felt reindeer whose nose lit up if you pressed it. “Grab your cocoa and find a spot. We have a full morning of festivities.”
Cocoa. In real mugs. That was another only-on-this-day tradition. The whole room smelled like chocolate and cinnamon as my classmates settled onto beanbags and carpet squares.
There were stories of old favorites that everyone knows about like The Snowy Day. The Polar Express. Even the one about the little pine tree that wanted to be chosen. Every time Mrs. Alder turned a page, the lights from the tiny Christmas tree on her desk flickered across her glasses.
Then came the Secret Santa gift exchange. The room erupted into laughter and delighted squeals as ribbons were torn, tissue paper flew, and someone’s glittery slime kit immediately ended up stuck to a desk. Marco opened his gift a small silver bell on a red ribbon. Simple, shiny, perfect.
“It reminded me of you,” said Sam, her Secret Snowflake, blushing. “Because you always hear things nobody else does.”
Marco wasn’t sure what that meant, but he liked it anyway and said thank you so much and wore it for the next couple of days. He looped the ribbon around her wrist, letting the bell chime softly when he moved.
As the end of the day came to a near, Mrs. Alder dimmed the lights and let everyone watch the snow drift outside the windows. Everything felt slower, quieter, like the world was pausing just long enough for them to soak in the moment.
“Before you go,” she said gently, “I want everyone to make a wish. Not out loud just in your heart.”
Marco closed his eyes and made a wish. Every year he tells us that he makes the same wish but never the actual wish.I think that he wished for the feeling of today would last. When he was older, he’d still remember how the last day before Christmas break felt. The warm classroom. The cocoa. The glitter. The snow. The way everyone seemed a little kinder.How on this very special day everyone was more than classmates or friends but they were family.
When the final bell rang, the one that usually sent kids thundering out the door, no one rushed. They walked slowly, like they knew they were leaving something special behind. Outside, parents waited in cars with heaters humming, windows fogging. Kids waved to each other through swirling snow.Each car was playing Christmas music with the smell of sugar cookies,hot coco, and candy canes everywhere.
Marco paused before stepping into his mom’s car. He looked back at the school one last time, lights glowing warmly through the frosted windows and listened to the tiny bell on his wrist as it chimed in the cold air.When all of a sudden..
Boom, a big pile of snow surrounded all of the cars.Each car was covered in snow and all you could hear was Christmas music and sounds of help. There were people to open doors,open windows, and at this point open anything they could.The snow was 6ft tall covering cars, people,and even some buildings.
Everyone was so bummed out knowing that they had a full day of plans ahead of them.Some started complaining about the snow but Marco knew exactly what to do. He told his mom to wait in the car while he somehow was trying to get out of it.Once he was out he found a couple of his friends still inside of school and told them to get many shovels as possible and from there they got to work.
They asked their teacher for help because they realized they weren’t able to do it on their own. With everyone helping the snow got smaller and smaller.Some cars were fully clear from the snow and started to help.After about 3-5 hours it got darker and colder but the snow was gone.When everyone was able to get out they realized something. Something so special that no words can describe because it wasn’t what they were saying what was happening but instead what it sounded like. The sounds of kids laughing getting along,the sound of parents talking and saying to hi to some who they haven’t seen for a quite a while.It sounded so perfect so magical
It sounded like magic.
It sounded like Christmas.

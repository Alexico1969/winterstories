A Winter Whose Center Would Not Hold
A Winter Whose Center Would Not Hold
A short story by Max Cruz
When Elias Merwin woke on the first morning of winter, the cold in his room felt unnatural, like it had settled there with intention. His attic window was covered by a solid layer of frost, thick enough that he couldn’t see the street outside. The daylight behind it came through in a weak, cloudy glow. He touched the glass. It didn’t simply feel cold—it felt like the frost was pulling heat out of his skin.
Sitting up took more effort than usual. His back cracked loudly, his arms heavy as if he’d been carrying something in his sleep. His room looked the same—peeling wallpaper, clothes piled in the corner, boots where he’d left them—but something about it all felt unfamiliar, like he was seeing it through a veil.
He picked up his father’s brass pocket watch from the nightstand. Its cover was fogged over again. He wiped it and frowned: it had stopped at 4:17, though he’d wound it the night before. As he bent to put on his boots, he noticed his shadow stretched longer than it should, delayed by a fraction of a second. Maybe the strange diffuse light through the frost was playing tricks. Three layers of clothes did little to stop the cold pressing against his skin.
The hallway outside his room had a faint layer of snow on the floorboards. Indoors. On the third floor. Mrs. Aldwych from across the hall swept it up with quick, nervous strokes.
“It’s the building,” she muttered. “Cold’s leaking out of the walls.” When he tried to suggest it was a draft, she snapped, “Drafts don’t make snow indoors.” Then, softer: “There’s a kind of winter that comes from weather, and another that comes from people.” Elias tried to laugh it off, but her words lingered.
Outside, the city felt frozen in a strange, expectant way. Snow piled in clean, sharp layers along rooftops. People moved slowly, as if disturbing the air might break something fragile. Even carriages and footsteps sounded muted. A municipal inspector stapled notices to posts announcing “frost irregularities” and “early deep-winter activity.” Frost clung unnaturally to Elias’s coat sleeve.
At the office, frost spiraled across the windows in intricate shapes. His coworkers sat stiffly, barely moving. Liese, the typist, showed him sketches of colleagues with frost creeping up their arms and shadows that didn’t match their bodies. She had drawn him too, a line of white forming at his collar.
“You’re changing,” she whispered. “This isn’t normal winter… it’s spreading.”
At noon, two municipal officers from the Bureau of Seasonal Conditions arrived. Their coats bore a snowflake inside an eye. They checked him, declared “Transformation Level Three,” and insisted he come with them for public safety. Liese protested that he was still himself, but Elias felt the truth in their words. Something inside him had been shifting all morning.
As they led him through the building, clarity washed over him. The signs he’d ignored—the frost under his fingertips, the delayed shadow, the weight in his limbs—had been pointing in one direction. The cold wasn’t just around him. It was inside him, shaping him.
In a window’s reflection, his face looked pale and translucent. His shadow had branched into crystalline shapes. He didn’t feel fear—only resignation. That night, frost thickened across the city in perfect, symmetrical patterns. Deep beneath the Bureau’s building, Elias lay beneath a pale light, frost curling from his breath.
An officer stamped his file:
TRANSFORMATION ONGOING — SUBJECT STABILIZED.
Some winters fall from the sky. Others rise from within. Elias finally understood which kind had found him.

Winter Story
Winter Story
A short, atmospheric piece about repetition and cold mornings
She woke up on Christmas Day to find her bedroom window wide open, snow drifting inside her room. She sighed and yawned before getting out of bed, “I must’ve left it open last night to watch the snow…” she muttered to herself before starting to hum a festive tune with a smile as she walked around her room. It was a typical 17-year-old’s room: a vanity, lots of clothes, and a bright  pink LED sign above her bed that read Elizabeth. “Still looks as good as when I got it,” she said calmly, sitting down at her vanity as she grabbed her hair brush
Snow drifting into a teen's cozy bedroom, morning light
Elizabeth ran the hairbrush softly through her curls, still humming that song stuck in her head since last night. The room was chillier than it usually ever got, though she blamed the window being open for that. Snow drifted in, almost magically, floating in slow, lazy spirals as if trying to dance along with her tune.
        She set the brush down and leaned in, peering at her reflection. “Merry Christmas to me,” she whispered
Already she could hear her little sister, Anna dancing around by the tree downstairs obviously shaking every gift to see if anything was obvious. She got up, stretched, and slipped into her red fuzzy slippers.
She made her way to the door, looking back at the window one last time.
The curtains were still, though the winter wind pushed through. And the snow… it wasn't melting
Curtains still while flakes drift through the window
She frowned but shrugged it off. Christmas magic, maybe. Or her room was extra cold whatever it didn’t matter anyway
The scent of bread and pine hit her as she came downstairs. Her mom was moving around the kitchen in her apron,  her dad was struggling to put a doll house for Anna.
“Merry Christmas!” Elizabeth said.
“Merry Christmas!” Anna said with a smile, launching herself into her sisters arms with all the force a seven year old could use. “Come on! We have to open presents now!”
Elizabeth sighed, as Anna  pulled her towards the tree. Dad finally managed to finish the doll house enough to join them, while Mom wiped her hands and brought over a loaf of bread.
Family gathered around a brightly lit Christmas tree, wrapping paper on the floor
Wrapping paper fell all over the floor around them. Anna screamed about every little thing she opened. Elizabeth got a camera she'd wanted, a bracelet from her grandma, and a small velvet box from her parents containing a silver necklace.
“It’s beautiful, thank you,” Elizabeth said happily.
Her mother smiled. "You’re welcome."
It felt like one of those cold perfect Christmas mornings.
      When they finished, her mom clapped her hands. “All right. We need to get ready. The party starts at four. Elizabeth, go get ready!”
Elizabeth nodded, still smiling. She went back upstairs, again humming, hugging her new camera to her chest.
But halfway up the stairs, her humming immediately stopped
Something felt wrong.
She wasn't sure why, but her heart suddenly pounded faster. A wave of dizziness washed over her. She grasped the railing tightly.
Maybe she stood up too fast or she needed more sleep.
Her door opened a bit, but she thought she had closed it. She froze as she pushed it in.
Her window was slightly closed.
She hadn’t done that.
The snow was not there melted by now. The curtains hung absolutely still. Everything was just as it should be.
      But she felt it.
A wrongness. Like someone was watching
A chill in the room, sense of being watched reflected in a vanity mirror
She swallowed and tried shaking it off. “Get ready,” she muttered. “That’s all I have to do.”
She changed into a pink red dress. She put on the necklace. She brushed her hair all over again, the bristles going through her hair.
Then 20 minutes later downstairs she heard her family calling from downstairs.
At first, the drive to the Christmas party was peaceful. The roads were lined with lights, inflatables, and glowing reindeer. Anna sang carols so loudly it was impossible not to laugh
But halfway, the car stopped midway.
“Did you feel that?” her dad muttered, frowning toward the dashboard.
Elizabeth looked around confused. Rain—or snow—hit the windshield in strange thumps, almost like clumps falling from the sky rather than steady flakes.
The sky grew unnaturally dark.
Then—
Then something appeared on the road.
Her mom shrieked.
Her dad swerved.
And everything-utterly everything-went white.
Elizabeth gasped.
Her eyes flew open.
She lay in bed.
Her room was cold.
The window was open.
Snow was drifting inside.
She bolted upright so fast her vision blurred. "A dream?
She looked at her phone.
December 25th
Christmas Day.
Precisely the same.
“Elizabeth ! Wake-up time!” her mom called out from downstairs, as chipper as ever.
Elizabeth's hands shook as she pushed her covers off. She staggered to the window.
Same snow. Same drifting pattern. Same un-melted flakes.
Her breath shook. “No it felt real?
She ran downstairs, and sure enough a loaf of bread. Her dad assembled the doll house. Annie shaking presents.
Everything she had already seen.
" Déjà vu?" her dad teased when he caught her staring.
But Elizabeth only shook her head slowly.
She knew it.
It wasn’t déjà vu.
It was happening again.
She tried to work out changes.
When Annie handed her a present, Elizabeth grabbed her arm gently. “Don’t jump on me this time, okay?
Annie blinked. "Uhm.. okay?"
Her parents looked at each other, confused.
Elizabeth opened her presents. Same polaroid camera. Same necklace. Same bracelet.
Her mom still clapped and said the same line about getting ready.
Elizabeth's heart hammered, yet she made her way upstairs.
Suppose she didn’t wear the dress?
She chose a completely different outfit.
      She did not put on the necklace.
      She even tied up her hair instead of brushing it.
      But when she opened her bedroom door again, her reflection in the vanity mirror froze her with a start.
She was wearing the red dress.
The necklace propped up against her neck .
Her hair was down and combed to perfect smoothness.
She hadn’t done any of that.
Her reflection tilted its head to the side almost in confusion before it’s smiled back at her. She stumbled back . But in real life-she hadn't moved at all.
Her reflection lifted the hairbrush slowly and mouthed something she couldn't hear.
Elizabeth spun away from the mirror and bolted out of her room.
When it was time to drive to the party again, she refused.
“I’ll walk,” she said, taking her coat.
Her parents argued. Annie whined. But Elizabeth would not be moved.
She walked along the snow-lined sidewalk, gripping her phone, while the sky seemed darker than it was supposed to be.
Halfway there, her breath fogging in front of her, she heard it.
The crunch of footsteps behind her.
Slow. She turned
No one was there.
The wind was howling, but the footsteps continued. circling her.
She broke into a run.
Lights blurred, houses flickered, snow fell in heavy sheets.
Then
A shadowy creature dropped into her path.
Elizabeth screamed
      And the world went white again.
She woke up in her bed.
Christmas morning.
The window is open.
Snow drifting inside.
Her heart dropped.
“How do I stop this?” she muttered after the 5th time this loop had happened .
Because now she knew.
Whatever she did
the day would reset.
Something odd or just terrible would have occurred.
It would be different every time no matter what she did.
Endless snowfall through the open window, a looping morning
waking again to that same snow drifting through the same open window. Again. Again. And again.

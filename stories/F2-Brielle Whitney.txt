Winter Story
The making of a wonderful christmas
by brielle
Deep in the forest, where tall willows grow,
    Where winter brings sparkle and blankets of snow,
    A small bunny lived with a hop and a swish
    hineywhiskers the rabbit, who had a big wish.
He loved hearing stories from owls up high,
    And tales from the wind as it whooshed through the sky.
    But the stories he loved more than all of the rest
    Were Christmas stories those were the best.
    One frosty morning he said, “I know!
    I’ll bring Christmas magic right here to the snow!”
    He twitched his whiskers, his heart all aglow
    “It’s time Willow Woods had a Christmas show!”
He found Bramble the Bear, yawning wide by a tree.
    “Bramble, we’re having Christmas! Will you help me?”
    Bramble blinked slowly. “Is Christmas warm, dear?”
    “It’s warm in your heart,” said the bunny with cheer.
Next he found Lark, a fox quick on her feet.
    “Lark, we need helpers and maybe a treat!”
    “A treat?” said the fox. “Well, that sounds fun to me.
    Okay, little bunny, I’ll help decorate the tree!”
Soon squirrels and hedgehogs and deer gathered around.
    Even Pineclaws the porcupine came with a frown.
    “We want Christmas too!” all the animals cried.
    So Honeywhisker grinned, puffing up with great pride.
They hung shiny berries from branches so tall,
    And pinecones like ornaments down the tree’s wall.
    The squirrels brought acorns that sparkled with frost,
    And nothing they gathered was broken or lost.
    The owls helped them tie the last bows in the air.
    Bramble kept dozing, but no one would care.
    Soon Willow Woods shimmered with soft Christmas light
    A twinkly, sparkly, magical sight.
But Honeywhisker frowned. “Something’s missing,” he said.
    “A Christmas tree needs a bright star overhead.”
    The animals gasped. They looked up and around
    But no glowing star could be found anywhere.
    “It’s okay,” whispered Honeywhisker, ears drooping low.
    “I wanted it perfect… but maybe it won’t glow.”
He started to hop back to home through the snow,
    Feeling sad that his wish might not fully grow.
    “Wait!” squeaked a voice, tiny, golden, and sweet.
    A firefly floated down close to his feet.
    “My name is Wisp,” said the bright little bug.
    “I’ve watched you all work with such teamwork and love.”
    “If you need a star, well… I can shine bright.”
    Then up she flew, glowing warm in the night.
    She landed on top of the tall willow tree,
    Shining brighter than stars for all creatures to see.
The woods came to life with cheers, jingles, and joy.
    Bramble woke up with a loud, “Oh boy!”
    Frost crystals glittered with sparkles and gleam
    It looked like a picture from Honeywhisker’s dream.
That night they all gathered beneath Wisp’s bright glow.
    They laughed and they played in the soft swirling snow.
    They sipped acorn tea and they nibbled sweet treats.
    They danced to the music of thumping small feet.
    Honeywhisker smiled. “This is Christmas,” he said.
    With joy in his whiskers and ears turning red.
    Wisp snuggled close, glowing warm as could be.
    “Christmas,” she said, “starts inside you and me.”
    “It’s not about perfect,” she whispered so light.
    “It’s sharing your heart on a cold winter night.”
    He nodded and hugged her, his heart full of cheer
    The happiest bunny of all that whole year.
    And every Christmas after, when snow filled the sky,
    Wisp returned to the treetop

The Nutcracker and the Broken Voice
The Nutcracker and the Broken Voice
There once was a wooden nutcracker and a wind-up ballerina. The ballerina had no voice, 
        but remained delicate and perfect. She could only twirl whenever the owner of both toys 
        wanted her to, and had two purposes: to hum gentle tunes and to dance. The nutcracker, 
        unlike the ballerina, didn’t have two purposes, and his one sole purpose in life could 
        not be achieved because his jaw was weak and could not crack a nut. He was deemed useless 
        and a “waste” decor. The harsh cold never affected the nutcracker, because he was wooden 
        and did not feel such things. Even the warmth of fire was numb to him, but it never 
        bothered him, it was normal for puppets to not have such senses. But there was something 
        that did, which did not come from the fire, or the winter, or the snow.
Watching the ballerina twirl so gracefully and perfect made something in his chest feel 
        fuzzy and warm, like a fluffy blanket, even if he was wooden. At first, he admired her balance, how she could maintain the stillness of her tiny feet on the wooden base. But over time, he found himself waiting for those moments, listening for the soft click of her key. Something inside him shifted slowly and quietly, almost as if his wooden chest grew heavier and lighter all at once. He could swear that whenever he watched in awe, a golden hue outlined the ballerina’s figure. After watching his owner as well stare at his wife with such eyes, he then knew he was in love. But how can a broken nutcracker impress a beautiful ballerina if he can’t even function properly? This thought reeled in his mind, and he felt saddened. He climbed the shelves of the wooden cabinet to try and fix his jaw, like applying glue, or finding something harder to replace his lower one, but none of them would work! With a displeased sigh, he glanced at the ballerina. The nutcracker soon asked her, “Would you love me if I were stronger?” Unable to respond, the ballerina kept her eyes closed, smiling. 

Days passed in the dim cabinet light while dust settled on his shoulders. The ballerina stood in a perfectly still arabesque, until the owner lifted her with careful hands. He could hear the owner’s voice, despite being rough, soften near the delicate ballerina. The nutcracker only listened, imagining how it would feel to be handled with such gentleness. As he watched, an idea that love is shown through the voice, and so he wondered if the ballerina simply thought he was a waste of her own time. However that was not the actual case at all! The ballerina was indeed in love with the wooden nutcracker, but could not tell or express her feelings to the broken-hearted puppet. As the nights grew longer and the cabinet got darker, the nutcracker began to wonder if love was meant only for the perfect, the whole, the unbroken. One night, however, when the house had gone completely silent and the moonlight slipped through the thin gap in the cabinet doors, he heard a faint, wavering hum. It was not smooth like the melodies the ballerina usually produced—it trembled, rising and falling unevenly, like someone trying to speak without knowing how. He turned toward her, startled. Her key had not been wound; she was not dancing, yet her porcelain lips parted in the slightest, and a tiny crack of sound escaped. She was trying—fighting—straining to give him the one thing she had never been given: a voice. The nutcracker felt that same warm, fluttering sensation bloom inside his wooden chest, stronger than ever before. In her small, imperfect attempt to speak, he became confused and disturbed, anxious that she was trying to speak to reject him.It was Christmas Eve, and the owner was going to have guests over at his cabin. There would be bundles of beer bottles, confetti sprinkling the room, and liveliness filling the air. The owner wanted to impress his guests by showing his beautiful ballerina music box to them all. He dusted and cleaned her until she was shiny, and started twisting the handle. However, he realized that she danced and moved, but did not sing or hum. This baffled the owner, how could this be? So he went into his storage room and looked through every box, every cabinet and every corner. He picked some batteries and a screwdriver. He gently lifted the ballerina again, and lifted her to the room’s light source, looking up. The owner then started to fix her voice, slowly, until she was a perfect toy again! He was glad, but then glanced at the nutcracker, and gave a scoff. This reaction baffled and confused the nutcracker, even hurting him. He did not understand the context of the audible sound, but it didn’t feel warm like how the ballerina made him feel. Evening came, and the guests barged in. It became loud quickly, and laughter and joy burst through the air. The nutcracker couldn’t feel the cold coming from the door, but he sure felt the harsh winds, which pushed him back a few inches. Though it surprised him, he could admit that it was a thrilling change.

When it came time to impress the guests, the owner thought the fire was too small, and realized that there was not enough wood. He looked at his “useless” nutcracker, and tosses him to the fire. Some of the guests giggle, gasp or even complain. He could have fixed him too, but the owner thought it was a waste of time! The nutcracker burned in the heat, and his last form of comfort was hearing the ballerina sing, which said that she really did love him all along. They both truly loved each other, and there was nobody or anything that could break that bond of theirs. The nutcracker let out a satisfied sigh, and closed his eyes, relaxing his jaw too. The ballerina let out a singular tear from her forever smile.

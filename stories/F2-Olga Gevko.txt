The Heist That Almost Ruined Christmas
1.
There once was a tiny snowy town that adored Christmas a little too much.
It was a whole-town effort—lights on every roof, trees glowing in every shop window, and hot cocoa stands on every corner.
Most people loved it.
Except for Grudge McDonald.
Grudge hated the “Winter Jolly” more than icy sidewalks and burnt cookies. And he loved cookies.
A bit about him: he used to manage the town toy store, but it closed after he accidentally ordered  700 tiny  hamsters. He’s kind of a dork.
So every December, he just grumbled his way through the season.
One night, Grudge put on an elf costume, strapped on a cheap tactical vest, and whispered,
“Time to sabotage the festival. Just a little. Nothing illegal-ish.”
His brilliant plan:
Swap the cocoa with bitter coffee
Replace the carol books with fake lyrics
Make the reindeer robots twerk
Grudge snuck into the festival tent…
And froze.
2.
Someone was already inside.
A man wearing a Santa beard… dragging the giant
Beacon Bell
, the town’s most expensive decoration, across the snow.
But the wild part?
The thief looked
exactly
like Grudge.
Grudge gasped. “Oh no. Did I grow an evil clone?!”
The thief pointed at him, yelled “NO WITNESSES!” in a jolly Santa voice, and sprinted away.
“HEY!” Grudge yelled. “Get back here, you budget-version-of-me!”
He ran after him but immediately slipped on the ice, crashed into a snowman, and face-planted.
Very unheroic.
Seconds later, police sirens wailed.
3.
Officer Mira Snow—Pinebluff’s one and only cop—stepped out of her car.
She looked exhausted, like she ran purely on coffee and stress.
She shined her flashlight.
“Grudge. Why are you on the ground?”
“Because someone stole my face,” he said.
She squinted. “And the Beacon Bell?”
“It wasn’t me!”
She crossed her arms. “You’re wearing an elf outfit and night-vision goggles you definitely don’t know how to use.”
Grudge groaned. “Okay, yes, I was going to sabotage the festival. But in a cute way!”
That did not help him.
She dragged him to the station.
4.
At the station, Officer Snow pulled up the security footage.
Grudge pointed at the screen.
“That man is
not
me! He just… looks like me!”
Snow slapped her hand on the desk. “Grudge, meet your long-lost twin brother.”
“I DO NOT HAVE A LONG-LOST TWIN BROTHER!”
But Snow held up a forged birth certificate with Grudge’s name on it. He gasped dramatically.
Then she shoved someone into the room:
A smiling man with the same hair, same face, same permanently fussy eyebrows.
“Hello, brother!” he said, like he was in a soap opera.
“NO!” Grudge shouted. “You’re just a weirdo pretending to be me!”
“Grudge calling someone weird is wild,” Snow snorted.
The man beamed. “My name is Gavin. I’m a friendly conman! I pretend to be people’s long-lost twins. Helps me blend in.”
Officer Snow dropped her head onto the desk. “This town is exhausting.”
5.
Suddenly the station door flew open.
A tall man in an orange scarf rushed in—Mr. Van Winkel, the high school computer science teacher.
Polite, soft-spoken, always walking with purpose.
“In my country,” he said, panting, “bells are not supposed to talk. But this one hid a code.”
“What?” Grudge asked.
Van Winkel opened his laptop. Inside the Beacon Bell’s maintenance records was a scrambled map filled with strange symbols.
“It appears to be a code left by the thief—hidden in the bell.”
Officer Snow blinked. “Are you telling me our giant bell is basically a treasure chest?”
Gavin clapped. “YES! Your teacher gets it! Inside that bell is a map to money stolen years ago. The mayor’s family took it!”
“Why would he do that? Didn’t that old guy move away?” someone muttered.
Grudge groaned. “So the festival I hate is built on stolen cash?”
Van Winkel nodded. “In my country, we call this… suspicious.”
6.
Before anyone could react, the entire station went dark.
“In my country… that is not a good sign,” Van Winkel whispered.
A loud crash echoed outside.
“Sorry!” a high-pitched voice yelled.
Officer Snow groaned. “HOLLY!” She nudged Greg. “Why is she here? She’s a handful.”
The door burst open and Holly—Van Winkel’s hyperactive student—ran in carrying a laptop and two drinks.
Both drinks were for her. Both were unicorn cappuccinos from Starbucks.
“Did you run over here?” Snow asked, eyeing the cups.
“Of course I ran. Like a genius. Aren’t you supposed to be smart?” Holly rolled her eyes.
“I tried fixing the Christmas lights and accidentally rerouted the power to only the Big Tree,” she said. “It’s glowing like a supernova!”
During the chaos, Gavin slipped out of his cuffs.
Officer Snow shouted, “OH COME ON!”
Gavin bolted outside.
“FOLLOW ME IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH!”
Grudge ran after him.
Officer Snow followed.
Van Winkel and Holly followed because… why not?
7.
They reached the town square.
The giant Christmas tree glowed so bright it looked radioactive.
At the base stood Mayor Dale, holding the Beacon Bell like a championship trophy.
He smirked. “Looking for something?”
Officer Snow raised her taser. “Mayor Dale, you’re under arrest—”
“Ah-ah,” he said. “This bell belongs to my family. So does the treasure beneath Pinebluff.”
“What treasure?!” Grudge asked.
“The money my grandfather stole!” the mayor announced proudly. “It’s tradition.”
“THAT IS A TERRIBLE TRADITION!” Grudge yelled.
“Also illegal,” Snow added.
“Minor details,” the mayor said, pressing a remote button.
The ground cracked open.
Grudge shouted, “NO NO NO—”
And the floor collapsed beneath them.
8.
Grudge, Snow, and Van Winkel fell into a dark underground tunnel.
Snow groaned. “This is officially the worst night of my life.”
Van Winkel said, “In my country, basements are safe. This is… not that. Very unsafe.”
The mayor climbed down after them and sealed the trapdoor.
“You three are staying down here forever,” he said. “Can’t have you ruining my Christmas crime!”
Grudge yelled, “Why does everything in this town involve sparkles AND crime?!”
“I ask myself every day,” Snow muttered.
Van Winkel squinted at a rusty valve. “If we heat the metal above us, the door may open.”
Grudge, panicking, flailed his arms and bumped straight into the valve.
Steam blasted everywhere.
“YOU IDIOT?!” Holly screamed from above.
Van Winkel cheered. “Perfect!”
The hot steam shot upward—
BOOM!
The trapdoor blasted open.
The mayor was launched like confetti and landed face-first in an inflatable snowman.
“In my country… people cannot fly,” Van Winkel noted calmly.
9.
When Grudge climbed out, he found:
Gavin,
Holly,
and the very-annoyed Bell Choir Ladies
standing in a menacing V-formation around the mayor.
One grandma whacked him with a bell.
Another jabbed him with a candy cane.
“You messed with Pinebluff,” one of them hissed.
Gavin laughed. “Told you they were scary.”
Officer Snow cuffed the mayor and sighed.
“This is going to be the weirdest police report ever.”
10.
By morning:
The mayor was arrested.
The stolen money was found in an old underground vault.
The town cheered Grudge like he was a hero—even though he definitely didn’t mean to be.
Gavin was assigned to work as RidgeWoods’ mall Santa.
He loved it.
“I was born for this role,” he declared dramatically.
Mr. Van Winkel became famous after cracking the bell code.
Holly made shirts that said “IN MY COUNTRY, WE SOLVE CRIMES.”
And Grudge?
He was officially hired as the Holiday Safety Inspector—meaning he was paid to complain about decorations.
Most people would hate that job…
Grudge loved it.
He nearly cried from happiness.
Snow patted him on the shoulder. “See? Christmas isn’t so bad.”
Grudge snorted. “It’s terrible.”
But then something strange happened—
his lip twitched… then curved up…
a smile formed.
Everyone gasped.
And that was basically a Christmas miracle.

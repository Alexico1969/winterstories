The Snow that was Never Supposed to Fall: Frostveil
A winter short story
Snow never falls in the winter here. The snowstorm is sealed by a slumbering titan, deep in the Silent Peaks, a mountain range difficult to traverse as well as map. Long ago, the Titan Arios, pinnacle of magic and power, fought against Titan of Storm, Atheries. The battle took days, nearly shattering the realm, with the Titan Arios emerging as the winning.
Ancient peaks and the memory of titans.
There were consequences though. Atheries took on the form of an Unbounded Storm by anything except for Arios, and the power of magic and glyphcasting had been spread all over the realm. Seeing the problem of the still furious but defeated titan, Arios took it upon himself to keep the storm sealed by absorbing it and sleeping, keeping it dormant. However, this is ancient history, with the knowledge of the titan’s sacrifice being lost to time. This barrier of snow and storm has stood for generations, while down below humanity evolved and settled, cultivating civilization.
Now we cut to our protagonist Mira, a young apprentice to Thalen Breck in the Cartographer’s Concord, stuck in the snow clawing her way up and through the mountain range, partially filled map in one hand, pen & and notepad in the pocket, gloved up of course.
Mira, climbing the Silent Peaks with her half-drawn map.
Taking note of her surroundings, she notices not only the odd hum in the background, but the air of power around her. The snow falls onto the group, intriguing her. She holds out her palm to catch a snowflake, and sketches it into her map, causing something, let’s say unexpected, to happen. A golden light illuminated the area, the odd hum ceasing, the snowfall stopping. Mira watched as the signal flew from the map, infusing itself onto her arm, an eight-sided star forming under her wrist, a thick black line, manifesting itself through to her palm.
Mira recognized this type of line, it being called a zero line, a symbol coming from primal energy instead of regular magic, a type of extremely powerful magic user long thought to be extinct. Mira, astounded at this new discovery, curious of her newfound potential, rushes back down the mountains into her hometown of Frostveil. However, what she doesn’t know is that something has changed. Hidden away, something ancient has awakened.
As Mira descends the mountains, she notices rather suspicious anomalies. She notices Frostwolves [Dangerous, agitated wolves, attack when provoked or threatened, collars of frost on their necks, chilled fur] moving along civilian and trade paths as she nears the bottom of the mountain. Mira thinks to herself, “They’re out earlier than normal. The Frosties only come out around midnight, but it should only be late afternoon right now.” She chalks it up to a change in the season or something and keeps moving. She also takes note of the Rune Serpents [snakes with a pattern of rune language etched into their scales, more dangerous that Frostwolves, but an above average magic user can easily take them down] migrating toward the Silent Peaks, something that doesn’t happen very often, only during some winters and when large amounts of magical power seem to be exerted. Mira, still excited about her newfound power, doesn’t really care and keeps going.
Signs of unrest: frost-bitten tracks and slithering runes.
Finally, she reaches the path entering her town. Frostveil is your typical town, covered in a beautiful layer of snow from the recent snowfall, rooftops with sheets and kids playing in the streets. However, the people seemed to be worried and some citizens are scrambling in a panic. Mira asks one of the more official looking people what’s going on, and he simply shakes his head, telling her to go home.
Mira decides to go to her mentor, Thalen Breck, intending to ask him about the town’s current situation. To do this she can’t simply go to his place of residence, no, she must go to the Bureau of Magic to ask him about the issue. As Mira reaches the Bureau, she still takes awe of the buildings grand design and architecture. The Bureau of Magic stands at the center of Frostveil’s capital like a shard of sculpted winterlight — a towering structure carved from pale, translucent ice-stone that never melts. At first glance it looks like a glacier that decided to rise into the sky, but up close the structure reveals an impossible level of precision: every wall etched with delicate sigil-lines, every surface humming with faint glyph resonance. As Mira enters his office, she finds Thalen pacing about, a worried look in his eye.
The Bureau of Magic: ice-stone architecture humming with sigils.
“Mr. Breck!” Mira exclaimed. “What’s going on in town?” She asks him. Mr. Breck answers, “Ah Mira, glad to see you here. Right now, with the signal-like snow falling, all the factions are scrambling around to check if everything is okay around town and with everyone’s magic. I was about to go and check the Frozen Leyline myself, care to join me?
Mira didn’t hesitate. She followed Thalen out of the Bureau and into the streets of Frostveil, feeling the strange weight of the snow underfoot, softer than usual. The town had shifted while she was gone, and every corner seemed to ooze with unease. The usual laughter of children and clatter of merchants’ carts were replaced by hurried footsteps, worried whispers, and the occasional low growl that sent her head whipping toward the nearby alleys. Frostwolves prowled near the outskirts, their glowing blue eyes reflecting panic, their collars of ice-chilled metal vibrating faintly as if straining against invisible bonds.
As they moved toward the Frozen Leyline, Mira noticed the rune serpents weaving along the mountain paths, their scales etched in shimmering, cryptic patterns. The creatures usually avoided human settlements, yet now they moved with purpose, sliding toward the mountains in quiet urgency. Mira’s pulse quickened. This was no ordinary disturbance. The magic in the air, thick and humming, seemed to push at the edges of her gloves, climbing along her arms, tugging at the mark beneath her wrist. It pulsed in rhythm with the hum of the world around her, growing louder as they approached the crossing that spanned the icy ravine.
The Frozen Leyline appeared as it always had—a gleaming river of pure magical energy coursing beneath the ice-stone bridge—but now its surface shivered violently. Blue-white light flickered and pulsed like a heartbeat caught between calm and fury. The runes embedded into the bridge’s surface strained against the surging energy, crackling faintly with each pulse. The cold air seemed to thicken, vibrating with a low, resonant frequency that made the hairs on Mira’s arms stand on end.
Frostwolves emerged from the tree line, dozens of them, moving not with aggression but with an unsettling urgency. They circled the bridge, ears pinned back, teeth bared in cautious snarls. Their glowing eyes flicked between Mira, Thalen, and the Leyline itself, as if they were aware of something far larger than themselves awakening somewhere beyond the mountains. The runic collars on their necks pulsed weakly, unable to fully contain the energy driving them forward.
Mira felt her mark pulse in response to the Leyline, a thick warmth flowing up her arm, spreading to her fingertips. Every instinct in her body told her that she had a role in what was happening, though she did not yet understand it. The hum that had followed her through the Silent Peaks now resonated through the town itself, stretching into every alley, every frost-laden rooftop, and every frozen path of the mountains.
The air above the Silent Peaks darkened unnaturally. Snow swirled in chaotic spirals high above, the flakes glowing faintly with their own energy as if the storm itself had been roused from slumber. Mira’s eyes followed the twisting patterns, realizing that the storm’s movement mirrored the pulsing of her own mark. The thought struck her with a mixture of awe and terror: her awakening had triggered something far greater than herself.
The Leyline surged violently beneath the bridge, sending shivers through the ice beneath their boots. Small cracks formed along its surface, glowing blue as if veins of pure energy were straining to break free. Mira’s heart pounded. The Leyline had never reacted like this, never displayed this kind of instability. The energy was building, coiling, and twisting, pushing the boundaries of the bridge and the runes that were supposed to stabilize it.
From the shadowed woods beyond the town, a howl split the air, deeper and more resonant than any Frostwolf she had ever heard. Others answered, creating a chorus of tension that echoed off the mountains and back into the valley. Even the rune serpents paused in their movement, their glowing eyes fixated on the mountains as if watching something enormous stirring far above.
The ground trembled underfoot. Mira’s pulse matched the rhythm of the quaking ice beneath her boots. The Leyline screamed silently, a vibration that could be felt rather than heard, shaking her core. The snowflakes above her stopped midair for a heartbeat, then erupted into a flurry of energy, spiraling down like shards of frozen starlight.
Energy rising: the leyline and the town hold their breath.
Mira instinctively raised her gloved hand, and the mark beneath her wrist flared, a thick black line of primal energy spreading along her arm. She felt it hum with power, alive and aware, as if reaching out to the Leyline itself. The world around her seemed to bend, drawn toward the pulse of energy emanating from her. The Frostwolves’ growls grew louder, the rune serpents froze mid-slide, and the mountains themselves seemed to shiver in response.
Then the ground beneath the bridge cracked sharply, and the Leyline roared with an explosion of energy that sent shards of ice shooting into the air. Mira stumbled, barely catching herself against Thalen’s shoulder, but her gaze was locked above the peaks. Something enormous moved within the storm clouds, a shadow so vast it swallowed the sunlight. The air rippled as if the mountains themselves had exhaled, and the snow, which had been glittering and light moments before, fell in jagged, unnatural patterns, carrying with it a weight and intent that chilled Mira to her core.
Her mark throbbed violently, responding to the presence of the being in the storm, connecting her in ways she could not yet understand. The hum of magic, of primal energy, of a sleeping titan awakening, vibrated through her entire body. Every instinct screamed at her to run, to hide—but some deeper, unreasoning part of her knew she had been called to witness this, that she had been chosen as a part of whatever was stirring beyond the mountains.
The shadow shifted, large enough to blot out entire peaks. The winds rose with it, howling, carrying ice and snow that bit like knives. The Frostwolves scattered, yelping in confusion and fear. The rune serpents writhed, hissing, retreating into the underbrush. The Leyline pulsed so violently that the bridge itself began to fracture, glowing cracks snaking along the surface, spreading like veins of lightning.
And then, as the storm above roared in response, a deep, resonant voice seemed to echo in her mind, a vibration felt more than heard: “The seal… has weakened.”
Mira froze, her breath caught in her chest, the mark on her arm blazing brighter than ever. She looked at Thalen, who stood rigid, eyes wide with recognition and fear. Beyond him, the ice of the bridge cracked again, spreading faster now. Snow whirled around them, and the air felt impossibly heavy, thick with power that had not touched the world for centuries.
From somewhere deep within the Silent Peaks, a presence stirred. Massive, ancient, and aware. And with a single, thunderous exhalation, it began to move.
Mira’s heart pounded. The world was changing, the Leyline erupting in response, the storm answering to something lost to time. And in that moment, she realized she was no longer just an apprentice cartographer. She was part of what was coming, whether she wanted to be or not.
The first shadow of the titan passed over the peaks. The snow ceased falling in the town, replaced by a cold, unnatural wind that carried the scent of ice and power. The mountains groaned. The Leyline screamed.
And something, something enormous, opened its eye.

Winter Story
By Anonymous
The day everything started felt like a normal winter morning where the sky is gray. I was sitting on the floor of my kitchen with my sister, both of us bored out of our minds waiting for something interesting to happen, though we had no clue it actually would. My parents called us over with this energy that instantly made me suspicious. They’re usually pretty chill, so when they get excited about something, it’s always big. A few moments later, I found myself stuffing my luggage with every warm and comfortable piece of clothing I owned. Thick hoodies, fuzzy socks, my heaviest jacket, basically anything that would keep me nice and snug. I still didn’t totally understand what was going on, but my parents kept giving each other these looks like they were hiding the world’s best surprise.
When I finally understood that we were going to the actual North Pole, it didn’t feel real. Part of me almost didn’t believe it, because who just casually goes there? The flight was long, but I didn’t mind because the view outside the window was insane. As we flew farther north, the world turned completely white miles of snow and frozen mountains that looked untouched. The sun barely even rose. It just kind of hovered on the edge of the sky, making everything look like a dream. My sister kept pressing her forehead against the window and fogging it up, but I couldn’t blame her. I kept trying to imagine what the North Pole would feel like, and I couldn’t even get close.
When the plane finally touched down, my stomach flipped like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to be excited or terrified. The landing strip didn’t even look real. It wasn’t paved or anything, just a long stretch of packed snow with little flags stuck into the ground. The building beside it was tiny and looked like it was barely hanging on, like one strong wind could blow it away. Even with all my layers on, the cold hit me so fast it felt like it reached through my clothes and grabbed my bones. I had never felt anything like it.
We got into this bulky vehicle that looked like a tank but moved slow, rolling its giant treads over the ice like it was taking its time. Inside, it was warm but smelled like fuel and old metal. I sat pressed against the window, watching everything roll by in silence. The snow kept going forever, stretching into the distance with no trees or buildings or anything to break it up. It made me feel small in a way I didn’t expect, like the world had suddenly expanded and I was just this tiny speck passing through. After a while, the station came into view. It looked like a bunch of metal bubbles stuck together, shining faintly under the pale sky. Lights glowed through round windows, giving the whole place a weird, cozy feeling, like a tiny little home sitting at the edge of the planet.
Once we got settled inside, the warmth was so nice it almost made me sleepy. The halls echoed when we walked through them, and every sound felt important. My boots squeaked, my jacket rustled, and every little noise bounced around like the building was listening. I kept thinking about how far we were from home. There were no cars driving by, no people talking in the distance, no phones ringing, no anything. Just us and the cold. The first night, I barely slept. I kept waking up thinking I heard something outside, even though it was probably just the wind pushing against the walls. Every time I opened my eyes, the room glowed faint blue from the window, because the sun didn’t really rise here. It was like living inside permanently early in the morning.
I tried to convince myself that I was just imagining things because my brain wasn’t used to the silence. The next morning, everything felt even stranger. I stepped outside with my sister, and the air felt thinner, like it was too cold to breathe in all the way. The ground around the station was smooth, except for something that caught my eye immediately. There were marks pressed into the snow, leading away from the building and disappearing toward a long ridge in the distance. At first, I thought they were from some machine or maybe someone had gone on a walk earlier. But the shapes were all wrong. They were too big, too deep, and spaced out in a way that didn’t match anything I knew. I stared at them, feeling a weird twist in my stomach. It wasn’t fear exactly, but something that made my hands get cold inside my gloves.
My mind tried to come up with explanations, but none of them sounded right. I wasn’t the only one who noticed either. Soon everyone was out there, all of us looking down at the prints like they were some kind of message left in the snow. Nobody said anything, but the silence felt heavier than usual, like the whole station suddenly understood that something was different. For the rest of the day, the mood shifted. People moved quicker, checking equipment and talking quietly with their heads close together. Even though I couldn’t hear what they were saying, I could tell they weren’t brushing it off. The atmosphere felt tighter, like the building itself was nervous. I kept glancing out the windows every few minutes, expecting to see something moving out there on the empty stretch of ice.
Hours passed, but the weird feeling didn’t go away. My sister tried distracting herself by exploring the station, but every room seemed too quiet. I wandered after her anyway because staying still made me restless. The metal walls hummed softly with heat moving through pipes, but that was the only sound. Every time the wind hit the outside of the building, I felt it in my chest like a tiny vibration.
By the time the sky darkened again if you could even call it darkening, since it never got completely black the aurora started appearing. I had seen pictures before, but nothing compared to watching those ribbons of light move on their own. Green waves stretched across the sky, curling and shifting like they were alive. Sometimes purple flashed through them, creating streaks that faded as quickly as they appeared. Even with the strange feeling from earlier lingering in my mind, the lights were impossible to ignore. I stood outside longer than I should have, letting the cold creep into my jacket just so I could keep watching.
The whole world felt unreal, like I was standing inside some dream that didn’t belong to me. The snow gleamed faintly under the lights, and the horizon looked soft, almost like it was melting. I kept thinking about the prints we saw earlier and how they pointed toward the ridge. The ridge itself looked sharper now, its edges glowing faint green from the aurora. It made me wonder what could possibly be hiding behind it.
When I finally went back inside, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something out there was awake. Something that had noticed us arriving in its frozen home. I lay in bed that night listening to the wind, trying to tell myself everything was normal, but there was this constant buzzing in my head like a warning I didn’t understand. The next morning, I woke up with that same feeling. I walked to the window and rubbed away the thin layer of frost. The sky was a pale silver, almost white. The station lights were still glowing like tiny stars against the metal walls. But what caught my attention was the snow near the ridge.

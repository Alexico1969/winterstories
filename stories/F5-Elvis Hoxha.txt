Winter Story
Winter Story
A short tale
It was two days before Christmas, and the whole town looked like it had been dipped in powdered sugar. Snow covered every roof, every yard, and every car on the street. Even the street lights had little piles of snow sitting on top of them. Inside the Miller house, though, things did not feel peaceful at all. Thirteen-year-old Alex Miller sat on the couch with his arms crossed, staring at the front door like it was his enemy. His dad kept telling him all morning that he needed to "get in the Christmas spirit," but Alex didn't feel like doing anything except drinking hot chocolate and playing video games.
A town blanketed in fresh winter snow.
"Grab your boots!" his dad yelled from the hallway. "We're putting up the outdoor decorations today!"
Alex groaned so loudly that if someone had been walking their dog outside, they probably would have heard him. Hanging decorations meant standing out in freezing wind for hours while his dad told old stories he told every single year. Alex tried everything to get out of it. He complained. He stalled. He said he felt sick. He even coughed like an actor in a bad school play. But nothing worked.
"I don't feel like it," Alex said finally.
“Well, I don’t feel like freezing my fingers off,” his dad said, “but traditions matter.”
“Not to me,” Alex said under his breath.
The front door waiting, cold wind sweeping across the porch.
His father didn't say anything. "I'm going out," he said. "Come out when you feel like it."
The front door opened, and a cold burst of air blew in before slamming shut once more. Alex just sat for a moment staring at the door. His dad always made sure everything was perfect on Christmas, even when Alex wanted to do nothing. As Alex sat there, he started to become annoyed with every second that passed.
And then, an idea popped into his head. A wrong idea. Kind of evil, even. Yet. a satisfying one.
What if he hadn't let his dad back inside?
He would not do it for long-just long enough to show his dad that he was tired of being forced into Christmas chores every year. Maybe then his dad would finally listen.
Alex stood up and walked over to the door, quietly locking it.
Click.
“There,” he whispered. “Have fun out there.”
He looked out the window. His dad was tugging the ladder across the yard through the thick snow, almost slipping twice. Usually Alex would have burst out laughing, but he was too irritated to think anything was amusing.
His dad struggling with a ladder in deep winter snow.
After about twenty minutes, his dad came back to the door, trying to open it. Finding it wouldn't budge, he tried harder. Then came the knock.
“Alex? The door stuck! Open up!”
Alex grabbed a cookie from the table and took a big bite like nothing was happening.
“Alex?” his dad called again. “Come on, buddy. I need help with the ladder!”
Alex didn't stir or utter a word. After a while, his father relented and headed back to the decorations.
Alex looked out the window again. His dad had his hands held up to his mouth, blowing warm air on them. He was clearly freezing. The inflatable Santa kept toppling to its side, and the lights were in a mashed-up knot. A twinge of guilt prodded Alex's tummy, but he nudged it aside. Dad never listened when Alex said he didn't wanna do something. Maybe this was the only way to get his attention for real.
Another half an hour passed, and the guilt grew bigger. His dad now looked even colder, and the wind had noticeably risen. He kept rubbing his hands together and shivering. Alex told himself it wasn't technically his fault because his dad had chosen to go outside, but that excuse didn't make him feel better.
The winter wind making decorations flap and sway wildly.
Then it happened.
Alex watched his dad again climb the ladder to fix the lights near the top. His foot slipped on an icy step, and he fell straight into a pile of snow. For half a second, Alex laughed, because it did look kind of funny; then the laugh died in his throat as his dad stayed down longer than before. Finally his dad got up, brushing off the snow with slow tired movements.
He didn't attempt the decorations again; rather, he walked directly toward the front door.
Alex jumped away from the window as though an incoming snowball had been thrown at him. He dove back onto the couch and tried to sit normally, though his heart was racing.
The doorknob turned. It remained locked.
There was a very long pause.
Then a softer knock.
Alex walked to the door, unlocking it with shaking fingers. When he opened it, his dad was standing there covered in snow, his cheeks red from the freezing wind. He didn't look angry. He just looked disappointed.
"You done with your little experiment?" he asked.
Alex nodded a little. “Yeah.”
His father stepped inside and shut the door behind him. Snow slid off his coat and hit the floor.
"So," his dad said, brushing snow from his sleeves, "want to tell me why you thought locking me outside was a good idea?
Alex stared at his socks. "I just didn't want to do decorations today," he said. "You always make me do stuff even when I say I don't want to. I just wanted you to listen."
His dad returning inside, dusted with snow.
His dad looked surprised. “I hadn’t realized you felt that way. Guess I just got so caught up in continuing all our traditions the same, I never stopped to consider whether you enjoyed them or not.”
Alex shrugged. "I like some of them. Just not standing outside forever."
His dad gave a tired laugh. “Alright then. That's fair enough, I suppose.
There was a moment of silence, then his dad said, “How about we skip the outside decorations this year? We can stay inside, make hot chocolate, and watch a movie. You pick it.”
Alex felt relief flood through him. "Yeah. That sounds way better."
“And next time,” his dad added, “you talk to me. No more locking me out.”
Alex smiled. “I won’t.” His dad raised an eyebrow. “Promise?” Alex nodded. His father ruffled his hair and slung up his scarf. Snow was melting on the floor in small puddles but, for the first time since that morning, the house felt warm and still again. Even without the trimmings outside, it finally felt like Christmas.

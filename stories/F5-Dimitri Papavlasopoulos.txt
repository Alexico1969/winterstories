Winter Story
By Dimitri Papavlasopoulos
Snow was falling outside twelve-year-old Dimitri’s window. Christmas lights were glowing on every house. Everything looked nice, but Dimitri did not feel happy. He was home alone on Christmas Eve.
His parents were stuck in another city because their flight got canceled. A big snowstorm had closed the roads and the airport. They called him many times to check on him, but Dimitri still felt lonely. He tried to be brave. His parents had left food, the neighbors were close by, and he was old enough to stay home for one night. Still, he wished his family was there.
Dimitri turned on the Christmas tree lights. The ornaments shined softly. He sat on the couch with a blanket. The house felt too quiet. Usually, his mom played music and his dad baked cookies on Christmas Eve. Now the house was silent.
To pass time, Dimitri decided to bake cookies like his dad. He followed the recipe, mixed the ingredients, and put the tray in the oven. The warm smell made him feel a little better. He made hot chocolate and waited for the timer.
“I wish Mom and Dad were here,” Dimitri whispered.
Then the lights flickered. The heater stopped. The whole house went dark.
Dimitri froze. The storm must have knocked out the power. He grabbed a flashlight and turned it on. Shadows moved on the walls, but at least he could see.
He called his parents. The call dropped at first, but then his mom answered.
“We’re so sorry, sweetie,” she said. “Are you okay?”
“I’m fine,” Dimitri said. “But the power went out.”
“Stay warm. Stay inside. Call us if you need anything,” she told him.
After the call, Dimitri checked the cookies. They were half-baked now that the oven was off. He pulled the tray out. They looked funny, but he ate one anyway. It tasted soft and sweet.
Then he heard a noise outside.
Crunch. Crunch. Footsteps in the snow.
Dimitri turned off his flashlight. His heart beat fast. Someone was walking up to the house.
He peeked through the curtains and saw a shape moving toward the front door. He backed away. His phone was almost dead.
A loud knock hit the door.
Then another.
“Hello?” a man’s voice called. “It’s Mr. Thompson from next door!”
Dimitri let out a breath. It was only the neighbor. His parents had told him the neighbor would check on him.
Dimitri opened the door a little. Snow covered Mr. Thompson’s coat. He smiled.
“Just making sure you’re okay,” he said. “Your power went out too?”
“Yeah,” Dimitri said.
“I brought you two lanterns and extra blankets,” Mr. Thompson said. “If you need anything, our door is open.”
“Thank you,” Dimitri said.
Mr. Thompson set the things on the porch and left. Dimitri carried the lanterns inside. The warm light made the house feel safer. He put one near the tree and one in the kitchen.
The snow was falling slower now. The storm was calming down.
Dimitri sat in the living room with the blanket around him. He didn’t feel scared anymore.
Then he remembered the small present his parents left for him to open on Christmas Eve. He picked it up and unwrapped it. Inside was a music box shaped like a snow globe. When he wound it up, tiny lights glowed inside and a soft song played.
The music made him smile. Even though his parents weren’t home, they still made him feel loved.
His phone buzzed. A text from his mom said: We love you. Merry Christmas Eve.
Dimitri replied: I’m okay. I miss you. Merry Christmas.
Right then, the lights flickered again—then turned back on. The heater started. The tree lit up.
Dimitri smiled. He turned off the lanterns and plugged in his phone. The house felt warm again.
He curled up on the couch. The snow globe music played softly. The storm outside had almost stopped.
Even though he was alone, he didn’t feel lonely now. He had neighbors who cared, parents who loved him, and a glowing Christmas tree beside him.
As he closed his eyes, he whispered, “Merry Christmas.”
And he finally felt the Christmas spirit.

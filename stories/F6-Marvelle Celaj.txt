Winter Story
Winter Story
Annapurna is the cause of over 72 fatalities, averaging about 1 death per 2 successful climbers, making it one of the deadliest mountains on earth. The chances are much narrower during the winter. Only six successful winter summits were made, compared to the overall 350. However, 14 year old Connor Hale attempts to take on a bigger feat. He will attempt to summit Annapurna by its southeast ridge, which is one that remains unclimbed.
December 31, 2019
He was fourteen. Too young, everyone had said. Too small, the papers had insisted. Too impossible, the world agreed. But Connor hadn’t come to Annapurna during the winter to prove the world wrong. He had come to prove something to himself.
“Not that ridge,” his father had warned whenever Connor’s eyes drifted toward the mountain. “The southeast ridge is a maze of ice. Even professionals don’t dare trying it.”
Perhaps that should have been enough, but Connor had much more curiosity than caution, and the southeast ridge called to him with a powerful insistence, tempting him to climb.
He didn’t plan to climb it alone. That would be absurd. But the idea slowly grew in him until the day he decided to actually do it. Connor had realized he knew the local terrain better than most, if not all alpinists. After all, he and his father mapped glaciers together every spring. He had studied these terrains for as long as he could remember.
One late winter morning, Connor packed climbing kit and set off to explore the ridge. He had a rope, harness, ice axe, two granola bars, and the walkie-talkie his mother insisted he carry everywhere. He wasn’t going to summit, just explore, he told himself. Just see if the southeast ridge was as impossible as everyone said. He would be back before sundown.
However, mountains have a habit of turning “just exploring” into something much bigger.
The ascent to the ridge’s base was familiar, but that made it no easier. It did not take long before his lungs started burning. He was only fourteen, and altitude did not care about passion or potential.
By the time he reached the first steep incline of the southeast ridge, Connor’s legs already felt weak, threatening to collapse under him. It surprised him; he’d climbed higher mountains before, but never this route. The ridge angled upward in a thin line, one that looked impossible to climb. However, Connor had already gotten so far, and he didn’t want his day’s work to go to waste. He anchored his axe, forced his feet into the footholds he could grasp, and committed.
The climb demanded everything at once. Strength, balance, practicality, and intuition. The ice under him felt brittle and thin, but all Connor could do now was keep climbing. His breaths came shallow and fast, too fast. He began to panic. He reached into his pocket, searching for the walkie-talkie to contact his mother, but in the motion he dropped it. Connor watched as it plummeted, wondering if he had just thrown away his opportunity to speak to his mother for one last time.
Still he went upward.
Midway along the ridge, clouds rolled in without warning. One moment he could see the valley below, the next he was climbing inside a gray void. The wind howled, ripping snow off of the mountain. Connor hunched low, fighting to stay balanced. The ridge was barely wider than his boots. The drop to either side vanished into mist. If Connor was sure about anything in the moment, it would’ve been that the mountain did not want him here.
Every step became a gamble. His rope snagged on protruding icicles, getting thinner with each one it hit. His boots slipped across glassy surfaces. His breathing was hard but nowhere near substantial. The lack of oxygen had hit him like a brick, and spots flickered at the edge of his vision. He forced himself to focus on motion—just one more axe placement, one more kick. The repetition helped him keep calm.
He slipped.
A patch of hidden ice sent his foot sliding, and for a split second, he dangled over a thousand-meter drop. His axe caught with a jolt that sent pain up his arm. He hung there, legs kicking against open air, the entire mountain helpless beneath him. For a moment he felt small, like a speck clinging to something far older, far wiser, and far more powerful.
He hauled himself back with slow, trembling movements. When he reached stability again, he stayed still for a long time, grateful to be alive. The exhaustion hit him like a wave. His arms shook violently. His heartbeat pounded out of his chest. The ridge was destroying him piece by piece.
He continued upward. Not because he was fearless and daring, but because of his curiosity eating at him. Turning back now would feel like leaving a question forever unanswered.
The weather worsened.
Snow began to fall in thick, heavy flakes, each one making the air colder and colder. The wind built until it pushed against him like an unstoppable force. His visibility shrank to a few meters. He angled toward a small ledge he had seen earlier, wide enough to rest. Each movement toward it felt slower than the last. His legs were turning stiff with cold and fatigue. His thoughts dulled.
He reached the ledge just as the wind shifted with a deep, deafening crack.
The avalanche that followed wasn’t unexpected; after all, he was on a snow-covered mountain. However, the distance of the sound caught Connor by surprise. The slope high above him fractured, and snow began to slide, first a whisper, then a steady, growing tide. Connor recognized the danger instantly. The ridge below would be swept clean. If he had been ten minutes slower, he would already be dead.
He pressed himself into the rock hovering on the ledge, curling inward as snow thundered past. The mountain shook. Ice and rocks tumbled off the walls. The air filled with force. He held himself as tight and small as possible, feeling the vibration of the avalanche in his bones.
When it ended, the world felt too quiet.
He looked down. Where the ridge had once been, now there was only a smooth, lethal slope. No path. No steps. No way back.
Stranded.
His breath shuddered. The fear and panic he’d shoved aside flooded in. His gloves were stiff with ice. His legs burned painfully, sending signs of frostbite. He had pushed his fourteen year old body harder than he ever imagined possible.
And yet, he had reached a place no climber had ever documented reaching on the southeast ridge.
It didn’t feel like triumph.
It felt like survival.
He forced himself upright. The storm clouds had broken just slightly, revealing the curve of the mountain above him—still impossibly far, but glowing faintly in the pale light. Even now, beaten up and exhausted, he felt the ridge pulling him towards it.
Not today. Maybe not for years. But someday.
For now, he focused on the only thing that mattered: staying alive until rescue reached him.
He stood on the ledge, breathing the thin, violent air. He was a small figure against the large white face of Annapurna. Every muscle ached, every breath hurt, but he felt something steady inside him, something shaped by struggle and accomplishment.
The mountain hadn’t beaten him.

Lorelai and the Bloxburg Christmas Crash
Lorelai and the Bloxburg Christmas Crash
By Creed Upton
Snow fell softly over the bright, blocky streets of Bloxburg, settling on rooftops like powdered sugar atop gingerbread houses. Inside a small blue suburban home on Bloxy Acres, fourteen-year-old Lorelai curled up on her couch, wrapped snuggly in a puffy blanket patterned with candy canes. Her mug of hot cocoa steamed gently, the sweet smell of marshmallows drifting upward.
`
She lifted the cup to her lips and took a slow sip, letting the warmth melt into her chest. It was the last week before Christmas, and all of Bloxburg was alight with excitement. People bustled around town decorating, shopping, and preparing for the big holiday festival in the town square. But tonight, Lorelai wasn’t outside helping string lights or baking cookies. She was enjoying a rare quiet evening at home with her favorite show on TV—Bloxburg News Network, the most famous news channel in town.
“…and in other news,” the anchor, Brock Bloxborn, said in his overly serious voice, “residents are advised to leave out extra-large cookies this Christmas Eve. Reports indicate that Santa has had a particularly exhausting year. Many are calling it ‘The Great Gift Surge of Bloxburg.’ More presents than ever before!”
Lorelai giggled and took another sip of cocoa. “Poor Santa,” she murmured. “Hope he likes chocolate chip.”
Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the icicles on the eaves of her house. A few loose snowflakes drifted through the air, but it seemed like an ordinary winter night—peaceful, calm, and cozy.
At least… until it wasn’t.
THUD!
The sound was so loud that Lorelai’s mug nearly leapt from her hand. Marshmallow-topped cocoa sloshed onto her blanket.
“What was THAT?” she gasped, eyes wide.
THUMP. SCRAAAPE.
Now her heart was racing. Something—someone—was definitely on her roof. Lorelai hesitated only a moment before leaping from the couch, blanket trailing behind her like a cape. Creeping to the window, she peeked outside.
Nothing.
Another thud shook the house.
“Okay, that’s it,” she whispered. “I’m investigating.”
Slipping into her boots, she grabbed her coat and hurried outside. The cold air bit at her nose. Snow crunched beneath her feet as she stepped back from the house to get a better view of the roof.
Her jaw dropped.
“S-Santa?!”
It really was him—bright red suit, fluffy white beard, shiny black boots. But instead of gracefully flying through the night sky in his majestic sled, Santa was dangling halfway off her roof, tangled in reins and ropes. His sled was tilted at an awkward angle, stuck between Lorelai’s chimney and TV antenna, while several reindeer paced nervously across the shingles.
Santa groaned. “Ho… ow… ho…”
“Are you okay?” Lorelai called.
“Not my most graceful landing,” Santa wheezed. “Oh dear, oh dear… Christmas Eve is only hours away and now look what’s become of my sled!”
Lorelai rushed closer. “What happened?”
“We hit an unexpected gust of wind,” Santa explained, trying to wiggle free. “Rudolph got spooked, Dasher slipped, and—well—you see the result.”
“How stuck are you?” Lorelai asked gently.
Santa gave the reins a tug.
The sled didn’t budge. Even the reindeer seemed embarrassed.
“Very,” he admitted.
Lorelai took a deep breath. “Okay. Don’t worry. I can help you.”
“You can?” His eyes sparkled even through his predicament.
She nodded. “I’m a Bloxburg resident. We fix things here. Houses, furniture, cars… and apparently sled crashes.”
Santa chuckled, sending a little puff of steam into the cold night air. “Well then, Lorelai, I believe you may be my Christmas miracle.”
With determination sparked inside her, Lorelai grabbed a ladder from her garage and set it against the house. She climbed carefully, step by icy step, until she reached the roof. The reindeer turned their large brown eyes toward her as she approached.
“Hi,” she whispered. “I’m here to help.”
Comet gave a soft snort of approval.
First, she examined the sled. One of the runners had cracked against the chimney; the reins were twisted around the antenna; and Santa’s heavy bag of gifts had spilled open, toys scattered like colorful confetti.
“This looks bad,” Lorelai said.
“But fixable?” Santa asked hopefully.
Lorelai thought for a moment. “Yes! I think so. We just need to work together.”
For the next hour, she and Santa teamed up beneath the chilly moonlight. She untangled the reins while Santa soothed the reindeer. She used a hammer from the garage to repair the cracked runner. Together, they gathered the scattered presents, checking Santa’s list twice to make sure every gift had been recovered.
The wind bit at her cheeks, but Lorelai didn’t slow down. After all… Christmas depended on this.
Finally, when the sled was upright again and Santa brushed snowflakes from his hat, he gave her a proud smile.
“Lorelai,” he said warmly, “you’ve saved Christmas.”
She felt a giddy glow in her chest. “Really?”
“Absolutely. Without you, I’d still be dangling off this roof like a confused ornament.”
She laughed. “Glad I could help.”
Santa stepped into his sled and flicked the reins gently. The reindeer perked up, ready to fly once more—but Santa hesitated and glanced back at her.
“You know,” he said thoughtfully, “there’s one last thing missing.”
“What’s that?”
“A hero deserves a reward.”
He reached into his bag and handed her a beautifully wrapped present. It was shaped oddly—almost like a book but thicker.
“Open it on Christmas morning,” Santa said. “And remember: even the smallest acts of kindness can save the biggest holiday.”
Lorelai felt her eyes shine. “Thank you, Santa.”
Santa saluted her with a gloved hand. “Thank you, Lorelai of Bloxburg.”
With a call of “On Dasher, on Dancer!” the reindeer bounded forward. The sled lifted from the roof, rising into the midnight sky in a swirl of snow. Lorelai watched, breathless, as Santa soared higher and higher until he was just a glowing dot above the twinkling town.
When she finally climbed down the ladder and returned inside, the Bloxburg News Network was still playing. Brock Bloxborn now reported, “BREAKING: Santa Claus spotted flying unusually low over Bloxburg. Experts suggest he may be adjusting his route for improved speed!”
Lorelai giggled, hugging the wrapped gift to her chest.
She sat back on the couch, grabbed a new glass of hot cocoa, and pulled her blanket close. As she sipped the warm sweetness and the snow continued falling outside, she felt a new sense of wonder.
She hadn’t just watched Christmas happen this year.
She’d helped save it.
And that, Lorelai knew, was a holiday memory she’d cherish forever.

Starring the Welz Family — The Christmas Light Disaster
Starring the Welz Family — The Christmas Light Disaster
Every year, the residents of Pinecrest Lane held a friendly Christmas-light competition. And every year, the undisputed champions were the Dawsons—masters of tasteful wreaths, elegant white lights, and a choir of animatronic angels that sang in perfect harmony.
That is, until the Welz family moved in next door.
The Welzes were enthusiastic, inventive, and—most dangerously—relentlessly competitive. And leading the charge was Jack Welz, the family’s self-appointed “Head of Holiday Engineering.” Jack was the kind of guy who treated Christmas like a tactical operation. He had blueprints. He had power-strip spreadsheets. He had contingency plans labeled A through Candy Cane Catastrophe Protocol.
Their very first December on Pinecrest Lane, Jack unveiled the Welz family’s opening salvo: a fifteen-foot inflatable Santa doing parkour over their garage. Behind it, Jack had installed a snow machine that blasted glittery “holiday powder” across the entire block every hour on the hour.
Residents would later swear that Jack cackled softly each time he refilled the glitter tank.
Pinecrest Lane had never seen anything like it.
The Conflict Begins
The Dawsons did not appreciate being dethroned.
Mrs. Dawson, who had accepted the “Most Harmonious Display” award for eight consecutive years, stared across the hedge with narrowed eyes as the inflatable parkour Santa bounced triumphantly in the winter breeze. Her angels—normally peaceful, serene, and slightly smug—seemed to glare in that direction too.
By the next evening, the Dawson house had sprouted an impressive new feature: a towering arch of shimmering lights framing their walkway, synchronized perfectly with a medley of classical carols. Neighborhood rumors claimed Mrs. Dawson had stayed up until 3 a.m. programming the light sequence out of pure, competitive fury.
Jack saw this as a declaration of war.
He spent the rest of the night hunched over his garage workbench, soldering wires and muttering things like, “They want to dance? I’ll show them dancing.”
The next morning, neighbors awoke to a new installment: twenty inflatable penguins forming a military-style phalanx on the Welz lawn. Every hour, the penguins executed a choreographed routine that included waddling, a salute, and a clumsy attempt at breakdancing—all accompanied by Jack’s custom mix of techno “Jingle Bells.”
The Dawsons nearly dropped their cocoa mugs.
Escalation
From that point on, neither family backed down.
The Dawsons added a set of glowing snowflakes that spiraled dramatically around their chimney.
Jack responded by installing a laser projector that cast swirling blizzards of blue and silver light across both properties—much to the Dawsons’ irritation.
The Dawsons installed a choir of angelic children who sang in three-part harmony.
Jack unveiled a 12-foot-tall Christmas tree welded from reclaimed metal pipes and wrapped in programmable LEDs, capable of spelling out phrases like “JOY,” “PEACE,” and “NICE TRY, DAWSONS.”
Every afternoon, neighbors gathered outside to watch the daily escalation unfold like some festive military exercise. Phones recorded videos. Debates broke out. One kid even created a scoreboard.
Meanwhile, Pinecrest Lane began to glow so brightly that the mayor reportedly received several calls asking if the town had installed an experimental new streetlighting system.
Jack’s Master Plan
By mid-December, Jack was working almost nonstop. His garage looked like the backstage area of a holiday-themed circus: tangled wires, half-assembled animatronics, and several devices that hummed ominously.
This year, he wasn’t just trying to win the competition.
He was trying to be legendary.
“Behold!” he told his family one evening, showing them a blueprint that looked like a cross between a Christmas float and a NASA rocket diagram. “The Welz Winter Titan.”
His family exchanged wary glances.
The Titan, as Jack called it, was a mechanical reindeer towering nearly sixteen feet tall. Jack had outfitted it with glowing antlers, motorized legs, a rotating head, and a speaker that could blast holiday greetings in eight languages.
It was glorious.
It was monstrous.
It was dangerously close to violating several municipal safety codes.
But Jack was determined.
“This,” he said dramatically, “will secure our legacy in Pinecrest Lane history.”
The Dawsons Strike Back
The Dawsons, meanwhile, were not idle. Their final installation was unveiled two nights before Christmas: a magnificent, thirty-foot-tall tree covered in 10,000 shimmering LED lights that rotated slowly on a motorized base. Each rotation ended with the lights spelling out PEACE ON EARTH in twelve languages.
Neighbors gasped.
Phones came out.
Even Jack stumbled backward and whispered, “Sweet mother of mistletoe…”
For the first time, he felt genuine worry. Could his Titan compete with this level of spectacle?
“Yes,” he finally decided. “Yes it can. And it will.”
The Great Blackout of Pinecrest Lane
December 23rd. The night of the final showdown. Word had spread so widely that even residents from neighboring streets came out to watch.
The air buzzed with anticipation.
At 7:12 p.m., the Dawsons powered on their rotating tree. The lights flared, brilliant and triumphant.
At 7:13 p.m., Jack activated the Titan.
It rose slowly from behind the garage like an ancient, holiday-themed deity. Its antlers illuminated, its eyes glowed, and a blast of multilingual greetings boomed through the night.
The crowd cheered.
Jack pumped both fists into the air.
The Dawsons squinted, unimpressed.
Then—at exactly 7:14:03 p.m.—the Titan unleashed its full lighting power.
At 7:14:04, the Dawson tree reached maximum brightness.
At 7:14:05, every house on Pinecrest Lane flickered.
At 7:14:06, the entire town of Willowbrook went dark.
The fans, inflatables, lights—everything—shut down at once.
A collective gasp rose.
Then silence.
Aftermath
The power company arrived thirty minutes later with grim expressions.
“You two overloaded the grid,” the technician said, pointing between Jack and the Dawsons. “Never seen anything like it. Frankly, I’m impressed you didn’t ignite something.”
Jack and the Dawsons exchanged sheepish looks. A few neighbors applauded sarcastically.
To make amends, Jack and the Dawsons agreed—much to everyone’s relief—to collaborate on a single, modest, tasteful (mostly) display. A simple tree, soft lights, and a sign that read:
“PINECREST LANE: NOW OPERATING AT SAFE WATTAGE LEVELS.”
On Christmas Eve, the entire neighborhood gathered around the collaborative display. They drank hot cocoa, laughed about the disaster, and agreed that despite the blackout… it was the most entertaining holiday season Pinecrest Lane had ever seen.
Jack smiled proudly, already sketching ideas for next year—just in case.

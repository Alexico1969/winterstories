The Clock That Stood Between Days
The Clock That Stood Between Days
By Zlatan Valdez
Evan Parker woke on Christmas morning to the soft glow of winter light slipping through his curtains. His room smelled faintly of pine from the tree downstairs, and the house buzzed with the quiet excitement that always came with his favorite holiday. Before he even had time to stretch, his little sister Lily burst through his door. “Evan! Get up! It’s Christmas!”
Laughing, he followed her downstairs, where wrapping paper already littered the carpet. The living room looked like a postcard—twinkling lights, snow drifting outside the window, and the tree shining with ornaments collected over the years. His parents greeted him with warm smiles and mugs of hot cocoa.
The day unfolded in a cozy rhythm: opening presents, talking with grandparents, and enjoying warm cinnamon rolls. Evan got a new pair of headphones and a hoodie in his favorite color. The family played board games, watched a movie, and ate more cookies than any of them admitted.
By nightfall, Evan felt pleasantly tired, the kind of tired that came with a full stomach and a full heart. He changed into pajamas and sank into bed. Everything felt right—until the ticking began. At first faint, then clearer. Tick… tock… tick… tock.
The sound didn’t belong. They didn’t even own a grandfather clock. He sat up, listening, unsure where it came from. When he checked the hallway, everything was still. Trying to shake off the unease, he returned to bed and eventually drifted to sleep.
When he woke, something felt off. His phone still read December 25. Christmas Day. Again. Downstairs, Lily shouted the same excited call as before. The living room looked exactly as it had yesterday—down to the tilted present under the tree.
The whole day repeated itself with eerie precision. Same conversations. Same gifts. Same snowflakes drifting in the same slow pattern. When the ticking returned that night, Evan followed it through the house and toward the basement.
In a far corner behind dusty boxes, he found it: an old grandfather clock, glowing faintly beneath the glass. Its pendulum swung steadily. A plaque read: TIME REPEATS FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO SEE.
Before Evan could react, the pendulum froze. A low chime echoed, and a flash of light filled the room. Suddenly, he was back in his bedroom—on Christmas morning. Again.
This time, he paid attention. He watched his family closely: Lily’s excitement, his mother’s laughter, his father’s quiet tiredness. He realized how much he’d been missing by rushing through life. The clock wasn’t trapping him—it was teaching him.
During this repeated Christmas, Evan listened more, helped willingly, and appreciated every moment. That night, he hugged his parents and whispered, “Thanks for everything.” The ticking never returned.
On the next morning, his phone finally showed December 26. Time had moved forward. Evan smiled, understanding what the clock had shown him: Christmas didn’t last forever, but the moments that mattered always would.

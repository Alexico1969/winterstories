Winter Story
by Kieran Long
On Christmas Eve, a man in his mid 50’s drives through a thick and snowy forest in the dark. He turns on the radio, switching through song after song until finally landing on a sports channel—anything to escape the Christmas music. The man, Liam, has hated all things Christmas for as long as he can remember.
Growing up poor, Christmas was a yearly reminder of what he didn’t have. No gifts, only ridicule from others. Even when his family could afford a few presents, he was always forgotten as the youngest of three. That changed when he met Hannah. Together they built a stable life, and when their daughter Ann was born on Christmas Day, Liam swore to give her the magical holidays he never had.
Every year he decorated, cooked, and gifted endlessly. And although seeing Ann’s joy helped heal him, the old pain never fully left. Everything changed on Ann’s 10th birthday. A blizzard struck, and when they realized they were missing food, Hannah insisted on going out. Liam tried to stop her—but she left anyway. She never returned. Her car crashed that Christmas Day.
That was the day Liam broke. He spiraled into drinking and depression, pushing Ann away. Only recently had he completed rehab and tried rebuilding his life. He still despised Christmas. The drive continues in silence until he reaches a cabin deep in the woods—the one place he expected Ann to be.
Two bundled-up kids rush outside the moment he pulls into the driveway, dragging him inside before he can even close the car door. Ann stands there smiling, different than he remembered but filled with warmth. They hug for a long time. Liam meets her husband George and finally the two energetic boys, Joshua and Adam.
The night goes on peacefully—until George brings up Hannah. Though Ann forgives Liam, George still resents him. He accuses Liam of abandoning his family and letting his wife go out into the storm. Liam stays silent, accepting the blame. Eventually he gathers his things and slips outside, discovering snow piled inside his open car.
Cold and defeated, Liam eventually returns inside. Ann and George fall silent mid-argument. Liam is shown to his room, where he finds Joshua and Adam waiting. They hug him tightly, just like Ann used to. They ask for bedtime stories to distract them from the tense night. Liam agrees.
In the boys’ room, he tells story after story about Ann as a child. When he finishes and heads for the door, the boys whisper words he hasn’t heard in years: “I love you.” And for the first time in a long time, Liam feels something warm inside him again.
Christmas morning arrives with excitement bursting from the boys. George still watches Liam with distrust. One by one the presents are opened until only one remains—addressed to Liam. Surprised, he unwraps it to reveal a small locket necklace.
Inside is a picture of Hannah. Liam breaks down, overwhelmed. He realizes that running from the past has only kept him trapped. Accepting it is the only way forward. Everyone in the room grows emotional.
After some time, George apologizes. While Liam was outside earlier, Ann explained everything—what happened, and how much Hannah meant to them both. George understands now. His love for Ann mirrors Liam’s love for Hannah.
The gift reminds Liam of what Hannah would have wanted: a family whole and happy, celebrating Christmas the way she dreamed. And for the first time in decades, Liam feels the warmth of Christmas again.

Winter Story
Sad Elf
By Madison Dalto
Once upon a time, in a cozy little cottage tucked away deep in the peppermint forests of the North Pole, there lived a young elf named Holly. Today was supposed to be the most important day of her life—her very first day of elf school. She had dreamed of this day for years. She had imagined waking up to the jingling of sleigh bells outside her window, slipping into her crisp new ginger dress, and proudly marching off toward the gleaming gingerbread classrooms. But things took a turn for the worst.
Holy woke before sunrise, her heart pumping with excitement. She hopped out of bed, humming a cheerful tune, and skipped toward the front door to grab the morning mail. But when she tugged on the handle, the door refused to budge. Confused, she pulled harder. Still nothing. Finally, with one giant pull, she managed to crack it open just enough to peek outside.Shock.
A mountain of snow had buried the entire front entrance. Not a neat little drift, but a towering, glittering pile reaching halfway up the candy-cane roof. The storm from last night must have been worse than she realized.
“Oh no… this can’t be happening,” she muttered, pressing her forehead dramatically against the door. She pushed, shoved, kicked, and even tried sweet-talking the stubborn snow, but it didn’t move. Not even an inch. Eventually she gave up, deciding she would deal with it after breakfast. School wasn’t for another two hours, she reminded herself. Plenty of time. Right?
Holly slipped into her green-and-gold school dress, smoothing the fabric with a sense of pride. At least something was going right. But when she trotted into the kitchen, her confidence crumbled faster than a stale gingerbread cookie.
She opened the first cabinet. Empty.
Second cabinet. Empty.
The fridge. Completely bare except for a lonely lump of what might have been pudding. Or cheese. Or possibly glue. Hard to tell.
“No cookies? No cakes? No caramel chimneys? Not even a single sprinkle?” she cried, throwing her hands into the air. Breakfast was supposed to be the best part of the morning. Every elf knew that. Starting the day without sugar was basically asking for disaster.
Still, she tried to stay upbeat. “Okay, no problem. I’ll just brush my teeth and—”
She froze in the doorway of the bathroom.
The shower was still running. Not a gentle sprinkle, but full blast, steam curling upward like an angry reindeer. Water sloshed across the tiles, pooling over the floor and spilling into the hallway.
“I did NOT leave that on all night,” she whispered, horrified.
She dashed forward, splashing wildly through the water, and slammed the shower handle off. But it was too late. The bathroom was practically a swimming pool now, her hairbrush floating gracefully past her ankle like a tiny wooden boat. She tiptoed deeper, pushing through the mess until she reached the sink. Trying to keep her balance, she brushed her teeth half underwater, sputtering bubbles and muttering something that definitely wasn’t festive.
By the time she finished, she was soaked, grumpy, and questioning even showing up to elf school.
Dripping and irritated, Holly stomped back to her room. She yanked open her dresser drawers—and instantly regretted it. Her neatly folded clothes from last night were nowhere to be seen. Everything was wrinkled, tangled, or mysteriously damp. Someone had definitely been rummaging. Maybe her mischievous little brothers. Maybe the house gnomes. Maybe the universe itself.
“Oh COME ON,” she groaned, ripping out the first halfway-dry outfit she could find and throwing it on with the enthusiasm of a sleepy snail.
Finally it was time for shoes. Reliable, dependable shoes. Shoes would not betray her.
Except they absolutely did.
Holly marched to her closet, took a deep breath, and opened the doors. What she found inside was chaos. Shoes were scattered everywhere—on the shelves, under scarves, tangled in ribbons, even dangling from hangers in pairs that did not match at all. It looked less like a closet and more like a tornado had taken a personal interest in her footwear.
“No, no, no, no…” she muttered as she dug through the mess. She found one red boot—too big. A sparkly silver slipper—too small. A fluffy pink snowshoe—definitely not right. She tore through the closet, flipping shirts and coats over her shoulder, sending scarves flying like colorful snakes. But no luck. Not a single matching pair of shoes.
Finally she slammed the closet doors shut, threw herself onto her bed, and let out a long, dramatic groan. “This is the WORST first day EVER.”
And at that moment, she heard it—a soft knock on her window.
Holly sat up instantly, her ears twitching at the sound. A knock? On her window? At this hour? She tiptoed across the room, careful not to slip on her damp socks, and peeked through the frosted glass.
Standing outside—shivering, hopping from foot to foot, and brushing snow off his hat—was her neighbor and best friend, Comet. He looked like he’d sprinted through a blizzard, which, judging by the state of his hair, he probably had.
Holly fumbled with the latch and pushed the window open. A gust of icy wind blasted into her room, swirling her papers and nearly knocking over a jar of peppermint ink.
“Comet? What are you doing? The front door is literally buried,” she said, hugging herself for warmth.
“I know!” Comet gasped. “That’s why I climbed up the gumdrop trellis. Took me, uh… longer than expected.” He wheezed dramatically and leaned against the window frame. “Anyway, I came to check if you were okay! Everyone was talking about how the storm hit your side of the forest the worst.”
Holly blinked. “Everyone? As in… the entire school already knows my house is buried in snow?”
“…Maybe?” Comet offered with an innocent shrug.
Holly groaned and buried her face in her hands. This day kept finding new ways to crumble.
“Okay, okay, don’t panic,” Comet said quickly. He climbed into her room and shook snow off his boots, creating a sad melting puddle on her floor. “We just need a plan. You want to make it to your first day, right?”
Holly nodded miserably. “I did. But everything’s going wrong. There’s no breakfast, the bathroom is a lake, my clothes are ruined, I can’t find my shoes, and the universe is personally attacking me.”
Comet tapped his chin thoughtfully. “Hmm… sounds like a big problem.”
“That’s not helpful,” Holly muttered.
“Good thing I’m a big-problem-solving expert!” he announced proudly, puffing out his little chest. “Step one: shoes. Lucky for you, I brought an extra pair.”
He dug into his satchel and pulled out… something.
Holly stared. “Comet… those are reindeer slippers.”
“They’re warm!”
“They have ANTLERS.”
“They’re festive!”
“They NAY when you walk.”
Comet sheepishly pressed one. It neighed loudly enough to rattle the windowpanes.
“…Okay, those might not be ideal,” he admitted, stuffing them back into his bag. “But! I know where we can get real shoes. The cobbler elves open early during storm season.”
Holly brightened slightly. “Really?”
“Absolutely. And as for breakfast—” Comet reached into his coat “—I brought emergency cookie rations.” He pulled out two slightly squished sugar cookies wrapped in parchment.
Holly’s eyes widened. “I take back everything I said. You’re a lifesaver.”
They each took a cookie, the sweet peppermint flavor warming their spirits instantly.
“Now,” Comet said, brushing crumbs off his mitten, “we just have to escape your house without using the front door.”
Holly looked at him. “Escape? As in… climb out the window?”
Comet grinned. “Exactly!”
Holly looked from the window to her soggy clothes to the ocean that used to be her bathroom. “Honestly,” she sighed, “why not? At this point, climbing out my window seems like the most normal thing I’ll do all day.”
Comet cheered. “That’s the spirit!”
With a determined breath, Holly grabbed her coat and wrapped a scarf around her neck three times. She swung one leg over the windowsill, then the other, and carefully climbed onto the snowy ledge. The wind nipped at her cheeks, but for the first time that morning, she felt something different—something like hope.
Comet climbed out after her, slipping only twice, which was impressive for Comet.
Together they stood on the roof, staring out at the glittering, snow-covered forest.
“Ready?” Comet asked.
Holly nodded.
“Let’s go save your first day of elf academy.”

Winter Story
12/24/25 Christmas Eve. A boy named Marco decided to 
        sleep over at his friend Kacper’s house. They wanted to stay up late               
        and catch Santa Claus in the act. They also panned to have a 
        snowball fight early in the morning.
Kacper only lives 15 minutes away 
        from Marco so he decided to ride his bike over to make it faster. Half 
        way to Kacper’s house Marco realized it was starting to snow heavily 
         so he started to ride fast. He got to the house put the bike in his
          garage and run inside. Kacper was waiting with hot chocolate
         because he knew he would be cold. Both of their parents are away on
         vacation.
The kids stayed up late to see if Santa came. They realized Santa 
         should have been there by now so Marco checked his houses camera to see  if Santa delivered his presents but then, they saw Santa stuck in the house due to all the thick snow covering the outside. They decided to escape the snow of Kacper’s house and go to Marcos house. It took about 40 minutes because of the snow holding them back.
They started to clear all the snow from the house. After they did, they went inside to Santa and he said I need help to get the rest of these presents to be delivered. They decided to help Santa and save Christmas. But would they get in on time? They went block by block and finished by 6:00AM almost caught by the last family. They all went back to the North Pole and Santa had to give them an extra gift for helping him. They got Santas phone number so every Christmas Santa will call them for help every year so they have extra time to rest. This is a moment they would never forget.

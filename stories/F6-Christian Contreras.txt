Winter Story
by Christian Contreras
He rushed into the hallway, sliding in his socks, ready to shout “Merry Christmas!” but when he reached the top of the stairs, the quiet nearly stopped him in his tracks. No lights lit the banister. No music played through the speakers. No crumbs, cookies, or hot cocoa aroma drifted through the air. The house felt… asleep.
“Mom?” Kacper called softly. No answer. He walked down the stairs carefully, the chill of the wood seeping through his socks. The living room came into view and the tree stood tall, decorated with silver tinsel and red ornaments, but not a single present sat beneath it.
Kacper froze. He stared for a long moment, thinking maybe Santa dropped them somewhere else — or maybe his parents moved them. He checked the couch, the table, behind the big chair by the window. Nothing. His heartbeat quickened.
Did Santa forget? Did something go wrong?
He hurried into the kitchen. Still silent. The cookies he’d left for Santa the night before were untouched, not even a nibble, the milk still full and cold. Kacper frowned. Something felt strange, like Christmas dissolved into a dream and left only the decorations behind. His heart squeezed. What if people forgot Christmas altogether?
He sat at the table, thinking, trying to make sense of the quiet morning. The digital clock on the microwave blinked: 6:47 AM — December 24. Kacper blinked.
December 24?
He rubbed his eyes, certain it was just a mistake. He stared again — December 24. Christmas Eve. He hadn’t missed Christmas at all. He was a whole day early. Relief washed over him like warm hot chocolate. He laughed to himself, dropping his head into his hands.
He smiled, but the house still felt too empty, too quiet. Kacper liked Christmas Eve almost as much as Christmas Day, the anticipation, the lights glowing at night, and the family laughter. But right now, nobody was awake to share it with him. So he decided he would make it the best Christmas Eve ever.
Kacper tiptoed through the hallway, looking at the world like a secret elf on a mission. First, he turned on the Christmas tree lights. They flickered to life, warm and golden, casting dancing sparkles across the walls. The ornaments shimmered, and for a moment Kacper felt like he was inside a snow globe.
He grabbed his mittens and scarf, tiptoed out the back door, and stepped into the fresh snow that blanketed the yard. His breath puffed into clouds as he smiled up at the sky. The world was silent still, but not in a lonely way — in a magical way, like Christmas was holding its breath just for him.
He knelt in the snow and started to work. Snow piled under his gloves as he shaped three round balls — one large, one medium, one small...
He rolled them carefully, stacking them like an icy snow-tower. He dug around for sticks, used stones for eyes, and found one of his mom’s old scarves to wrap around the snowman’s neck. By the time he finished, the sun peeked above the horizon, painting the world in soft light. The snowman stood proudly, smiling at him. Kacper smiled back.
By the time he returned inside, the house was beginning to wake. His mom appeared first, yawning, hair messy, wrapped in a blanket. She blinked at him. “Sweetheart, you’re up already?”
“I thought it was Christmas,” Kacper said sheepishly, laughing. “But it’s Christmas Eve.”
His mom smiled, soft and warm. “Well then, we get to celebrate twice.” His dad entered next, rubbing his eyes, and then his little sister, Mila, stumbled out with her stuffed reindeer...
They gathered in the living room together, lights twinkling, and Kacper felt something bloom in his chest — the joy he waited for, but bigger, brighter. “Since you’re our early elf,” his dad said, handing him a small box wrapped in red ribbon, “you get to open one present tonight.”
Kacper’s eyes widened. Before he could speak, his mom placed hot cocoa in front of him — the good kind, with whipped cream and peppermint sprinkles. Christmas music drifted through the room, soft and merry. The quiet morning was gone. The house was alive again.
The rest of the day passed like a dream. They baked cookies — and this time Santa would eat them. They decorated gingerbread houses until Mila’s collapsed leaning like a sugary tower. They watched classic Christmas movies, wrapped gifts, and when night fell, they stepped outside to admire Kacper’s snowman.
Under the Christmas Eve sky, with the house glowing behind them and snow crunching beneath their boots, Kacper felt full — like Christmas already lived inside him, even before the gifts, the feasts, and the morning rush.
Later that night, tucked into bed, tree lights flickering softly through his doorway, Kacper whispered to himself with a grin: “Tomorrow… it really will be Christmas.” He fell asleep smiling, knowing he hadn’t missed anything at all. In fact, he’d gotten something most people never experience — two Christmas mornings. One imagined, one real.
And just before sleep claimed him completely, he could’ve sworn he heard distant bells ringing across the snowy night.

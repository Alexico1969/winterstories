The Snowman’s promise

“Daddy, Daddy! Can you tell me a story?” said Alex. “Sure, but what kind of story would you like to hear?” said the father. “I want to hear a scary one,” Alex said. “I don’t know about that, Alex, you're about to go to bed,” said the father. “Please, Daddy.” “How about I tell you a story that my father once told me?” said the father. “Okay, sure,” said Alex.
Long ago, there was a boy named Carl who always seemed to be lonely. Kids his age never wanted to play with him or be his friend, except for his best friend, James. But this was not his only problem; he had nightmares every night, and he always woke up screaming. The night before, he had seen something so strange that he was sure his mom would think he was crazy if he told her. The next morning, Carl told James about what he had seen. “James! Hold up!” Carl said. “Yeah?” James replied. “I have something to tell you about my nightmare last night,” said Carl. “Did you see the snow monsters again?” James asked. “Yes, but this time it seemed real, not like a dream,” Carl said. “I don’t know about that,” James told him. “Please, James, you have to trust me. I am not crazy!” Carl insisted. “Okay, okay, I believe you. Now let me get to class so we can talk during lunch,” said James.
During lunch, Carl explained to James what he saw. “James, I know what I saw, and it felt real. You have to believe me,” Carl said. “What makes you think I don’t believe you?” James asked. “Because everyone always thinks I’m crazy, not me, but the dreams,” Carl added. “Well, I believe you, but I want to know what you saw,” James said. “I saw this giant monster over my bed trying to grab me and it did. I felt it, like it was real,” Carl said. “That’s weird,” James replied. “It was like I was in sleep paralysis or something,” Carl continued. “You need to go to church more,” James joked. “This isn’t funny,” Carl said, scared and angry because James was treating something serious like a joke.
The next day was a snow day, and Carl had not had any nightmares the night before. Carl’s mom wanted him to go outside and play in the snow, so after breakfast he went out to build a snowman. He eventually got bored and asked his mom if she needed anything. She asked him to go to the upper market to get groceries, and he agreed. On his way there, he saw some kids from school that he didn’t like. One of them asked, “Where are you heading?” Carl answered, “To the grocery store for my mom,” and the kid replied in a mean, sarcastic voice, “Awww, what a sweet boy.” Carl walked away, trying not to start any problems.
When Carl finished getting the groceries, he went back home. When he arrived, he noticed the snowman he had built was gone. He assumed someone had knocked it down and didn’t care much; he was tired and wanted to go to bed.
The next morning, he went to school, but as he left the house he noticed the snowman was back. This freaked him out, and he felt like he was being watched. After school, he rushed home quickly. He went up to the snowman, and suddenly the snowman grabbed his arm. Carl screamed. The snowman shushed him, which scared him even more. Then the snowman said, “My name is Frezzey.” Carl thought that was a strange name for a snowman. “What do you want?” Carl asked. “I am here to save you from the Snowtron,” Frezzey told him. “What is the Snowtron?” Carl asked. “A Snowtron is a snow monster that usually appears in dreams,” Frezzey explained. “How do you know that I’m seeing the Snowtron?” Carl asked. “I know a lot of things,” Frezzey said. “I promise to keep you safe.
The next morning, Frezzey told Carl that they needed to set up a trap for his nightmare that night, even though Carl wasn’t sure he would have one. Despite Carl’s doubts, Frezzey was absolutely certain the Snowtron would return, so Carl chose to trust him. They spent the afternoon preparing the room, setting small alarms near the windows, laying salt lines on the floor, and arranging pillows to slow down anything that tried to get close. Frezzey even carved strange frost symbols on the window, claiming they would confuse the Snowtron. Neither of them knew that the Snowtron had grown stronger and had something far worse planned than simply grabbing Carl in his sleep.
That night, as Carl got ready for bed, fear twisted in his stomach. “I’m scared to go to sleep tonight,” he admitted. Frezzey placed a gentle snowy hand on his shoulder and said, “Everything will be alright because I promised to keep you safe.” Carl hesitated. “But what if you don’t make it because of me?” Frezzey shook his head firmly. “My purpose is to protect you. Whatever happens, you will be safe.” His calm voice helped Carl relax, and a few minutes later, Carl drifted into sleep. Hours passed, until suddenly a bolt of red lightning struck the ground outside. Frezzey rushed to the window and saw a massive shadow rising from the snow the Snowtron was here. Frezzey raced outside, and the two snow creatures clashed in a fierce battle of ice and frost. The Snowtron roared and hurled frozen chunks of earth, but Frezzey fought bravely. With a final burst of icy strength, he shattered the Snowtron into thousands of sparkling snowflakes.
When the storm cleared, Frezzey returned inside and checked on Carl, who had slept through the entire battle. The next morning, Carl woke up to see Frezzey sitting by his bed, looking tired but smiling. Carl instantly knew what had happened. Filled with relief, he hugged Frezzey tightly. “Thank you for saving me,” he said. Frezzey hugged him back carefully. “I promised I would protect you,” he replied. From that day forward, Carl never felt alone again. THE END!
“So, Alex, how did you like this?” the father asked, and Alex replied, “That was the best story yet, Dad!” The father said, “You always fall asleep, but I guess you really liked this one. It’s time for bed,” and Alex answered, “Good night, Dad,” as the father said, “Good night, Alex.”

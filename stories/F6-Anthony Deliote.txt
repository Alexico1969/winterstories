ELF Revolution
ELF Revolution
By Anthony
The elves had enough of Santa’s rules, laws, and order. They decided enough was enough and started a revolution against Santa. Santa ordered the elves to work harder and faster. This was because more than 100 million people said their gifts were broken or destroyed, so Santa was going to punish the elves. The elves did nothing wrong, and in fact Santa’s driving skills had always been bad.
This Christmas, Santa crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, scattering gifts everywhere. Santa’s elves were blamed for the crash, and some were even punished harshly. The leader of the elf resistance, Parker Candycane, held a meeting with other elf political powers about the crash.
“Most of us know about the crash, and we have lost 50 elves. We will probably lose more if we don’t do anything.”
“Santa will pay for what he has done,” the second in command said.
“I will take my revenge. Us elves have had enough already.”
“But what can we do? Santa is powerful.”
“We will fight back, and I know how.”
Then the elf engineers arrived and revealed blueprints of a machine powerful enough to stop him.
The news of the crash spread like wildfire across the North Pole. All elves now knew about it, and confusion rose. Santa had always been the good guy—how could this be happening? At first the elves weren’t bothered, but as complaints increased, they had enough. Parker realized it was now or never and rallied the elves.
All the elves gathered in the town square and Parker began his speech. “My brothers and sisters. We all know why we’re here today. Santa’s demands are too much. His punishments and rules are too much for us. We need to rebel.”
His second in command stepped forward. “Dear elves, Santa must be stopped at all costs. We have lost too many.”
The crowd became silent. Though they had different thoughts, they all agreed that Santa’s rules needed to change.
Two high-ranked officials approached next. “Elves, we have a secret weapon that can destroy his sleigh in one go. If we destroy the sleigh, his power source will be go—"
Another official interrupted. “I have worked with Santa for years. Inside the sleigh is a power source constructed centuries ago by his father. If it’s destroyed, Santa’s power will drain completely. It’s called the Northernstar Breaker. But finishing the machine will take time.”
Parker gave one final speech. “We will give the engineers time. But now everyone must split into two groups. Group one will help the engineers. Group two will distract Santa.”
The next day, rebellion was in motion. Elves in group one hammered gears and metal plates. Sparks flew as welders worked. Caine, the leader of the project, oversaw the machine’s construction.
Meanwhile, the distraction teams moved through the workshop. Toys were misplaced, electric lines were slowed, and paint stations clogged with sticky candy. The elves in group two kept the reindeer busy with long grooming sessions disguised as inspections.
Santa noticed something was wrong and called his workers. “Why are we behind schedule?” he demanded.
“Our machines are breaking down,” an elf said.
“Fix it! We need to prepare presents for today.”
The workers rushed out, but Santa knew something deeper was happening. He called the Reindeer Captain, spies, and officials. “Something is up. I know one of your kind is responsible.”
Spies informed Parker of Santa’s suspicions. Parker gathered the high-ranking rebels in the underground workshop. “Santa is onto us. The machine is almost done, but we need more time—”
An elf burst into the room. “Santa is here! He’s searching everywhere. You must hide!”
Parker ordered his officials to flee while he ran toward the old storage vault.
Northernstar Breaker gave off a deep humming sound that echoed through the workshop. Santa paused on the stairs after hearing a loud blast.
When the smoke cleared, Santa stepped into the destroyed workshop and saw Parker standing firm. Parker didn’t hide—he wanted to fight back. Santa looked around at the shattered sleigh and the hiding elves.
“I never wanted this,” Santa said. “But I pushed you too hard. I forgot you weren’t just workers. You’re people.”
Parker hesitated. The rebellion was built on anger, and now Santa wanted peace. Some elves emerged to help those injured by flying debris. Even Santa turned to help. But Parker wasn’t finished.
“I never liked you,” Parker said. “You treated us like this for months over gifts? I want you gone. I want to lead.”
Parker ran to the machine and kicked the engineer aside. The weapon lowered, aiming at Santa and the elves behind him.
“Stop, Parker! If you fire again, it might destroy the machine and a quarter of the North Pole!” the lead engineer warned.
“I don’t care! As long as I get to see Santa fall!” Parker shouted.
As Parker prepared to fire, the second in command tackled him. Engineers tried desperately to stabilize the unstable machine, which was dangerous to even stand near.

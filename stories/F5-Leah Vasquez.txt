Winter Story
The Globe of Hidden Winter
By Leah Vasquez
On a snowy day, one week before Christmas Eve, lives a boy in the bourgeois town of Aurelian. The boy had gone around town, looking for trinkets to buy for his family. Orion Atherton, the boy, is a benevolent kid, who had always done good for his family and for those around him. Walking with his dog, Fenris, Orion went from shop to shop, in search of the perfect Christmas gift in favor of his family. He then approached a rather antique shop, where the sign was rusted and the windows were cracked. Orion, holding Fenris’s leash, opened the door with a loud creak of the broken hinge. “Welcome to The Gilded Reliquary! I am Mrs. Elderwood, the shopkeeper. Are you looking for anything in particular, or are you… exploring?” An erstwhile yet polished voice spoke from behind. The source of the voice was an elderly woman, with grizzled and unbrushed curls of grey, wearing a large, heavy-knit, dark wool and forest green shawl, draped across her shoulders and pinned at the front with a large, antique, tarnished silver brooch. The shawl is slightly threadbare in places, showing its age. To accessorize, she also wears rosy-colored glasses that rested on the bridge of her wrinkled nose. Although she appears to be of much age, her jade-colored eyes showed many signs of youth. Orion stopped in his tracks, turning around to face the woman. He smiled at her before speaking, “I’m just looking around. I am trying to find the perfect Christmas gift for my family.” Mrs. Elderwood smiled a rather indulgent smile, watching in peaked interest as Orion strolled among the aisles. Orion sauntered around the shop with curiosity while Fenris admired everything with the normal interest of a dog. “This shop, it’s beautiful. It seems like the place that time forgot.” Orion’s words were genuine; yes, he was very intrigued by the old attributes the boutique had. Mrs. Elderwood let out a soft chuckle at the words that left Orion’s chapped lips. “Ah, is that what you believe?”, says Mrs. Elderwood, “I believe that time has forgotten everything but here.” Orion raised a brow in curiosity. Could that really be the case? He opened his mouth to speak, or ask a question perhaps, but was interrupted by a holler from Fenris. Orion smiled apologetically at Mrs. Elderwood before his gaze locked upon a beautiful snowglobe with a shimmering stand, silver glitter for the snowflakes, and a perfectly transparent dome around the scenery of a colorless castle. He took it in one hand, his other still holding a firm grasp on Fenris’s leash. His eyes glistened in amazement, shock, and inquisitiveness, “Wow,” Orion said, his voice barely above a whisper, “This is… wow.”
No words could describe the adoration Orion felt. Mrs. Elderwood approached Orion, taking in mind the captivation this snowglobe must have had upon him. “That is a snowglobe, replicating Eunoctis, the land of the forgotten- or rather, the hidden. That land has never lived to see the summer. Not in the last millennium.” The smile on Mrs. Elderwood’s face had long faded. How could a simple folktale make Mrs. Elderwood feel such distraught? After a moment of silence, Mrs. Elderwood spoke once more, but this time, she isn’t elucidating intelligence. Rather, she admires Orion and Fenris with eyes of longing. Maybe, she longed for the youth that Orion possessed, the youth that had been taken away from her decades ago. At least, that is what Orion assumed. What he didn’t know was that Mrs. Elderwood wasn’t longing for the bloom of her life, but rather, she longed for the freedom from the icy totalitarianism of Eunoctis. “Agitate the snow-filled orb, would you? It is very nice, how the glitter gracefully falls onto the palace.” Orion did what was told, and suddenly, his vision began to whiten.
Orion felt a sudden chill, and everything spun until he felt a soft yet cold mineral beneath him. Snow. Orion was lying on a thick yet soft layer of glistening snow. “Snow? What just happened? I was just at the antique shop right-” Orion had paused midway through his sentence, as he could not spot the boutique anywhere- or any other signs of the town for that manner. Fenris let out a loud yelp, and Orion jerked up from the ground. “Fenris? What happened?” Fenris continued to bark loudly, and when Orion followed Fenris’s gaze, he was met with the sight of a reindeer prancing through the snow. The reindeer stopped in front of Orion, tilting her head before speaking. “What are you doing out here, with nothing to keep warm?” Orion’s eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Questions flooded his mind like a tsunami. But, before he could protest, or say anything in that manner, he was led into a small cabin. Orion was stunned, and his mouth was agape.
“Based on your shock, you must not be from Borealheim.” The reindeer’s tone was calm and rather reassuring than judging. A soft chuckle left the reindeer’s mouth before she continued to utter, “I am Lumina.” Orion and Fenris exchanged a glance before Orion spoke up, his tone shaky and of much confusion, “I am Orion- Orion Atherton. This is Fenris, my dog. And, is this the world from the snowglobe? I thought it was called Eunoctus.” The reindeer smiled in approval before her smile faded at Orion’s last word. Eunoctus. That was the original name of Borealheim, the name that symbolized unity and peace before the despotism of the unjust rulers, the evil snowmen. “You can’t say that name. Not anymore. If he knows, you will not be able to return to the world you came from.” Orion’s eyes widened in worry and shock, but he still felt nothing but uncertainty. “So, he knows about the story? Or just the name?” Another voice spoke up, one with a slight rasp and weariness. “Because, if he does, maybe he will be able to finally put an end to King Chillington and this maladministration.” Orion’s gaze followed the source of the voice before he was met with a fierce ogle of a coyote. “Orion Atherton, was it? I’m Koa. I tried many times to singlehandedly dethrone King Chillington, but I haven’t succeeded. But, with the help of a being from a different world, I think we will be able to depose this dictatorial democracy.”

Orion was taken aback. He was a moral with no fighting experience, especially not in some other world. He was still trying to comprehend the absurdity of everything happening. Talking animals. Prophecy. Dictatorship. And now he was apparently supposed to help defeat some tyrannical snowman king with a name that sounded like a joke someone would make at a Christmas party. King Chillington. Honestly, it sounded like the villain of a cheap winter cartoon. But from the panicked expressions of Lumina the reindeer, Koa the coyote, and the tiny gingerbread guy who had nearly caused Orion a heart attack, he seemed to be acquainted with Lumina and Koa, as they refer to him by a name ‘Pryde’. Chillington was no laughing matter.
The group finally slowed at the foot of a frosty ridge. Lumina lowered her head gently so Orion could slide off her back. Fenris bounded into the snow, nose twitching happily like this was the greatest field trip of his life. The gingerbread helper, Pryde, leapt onto a snowbank and struck an overly dramatic pose with his peppermint staff raised like it was some sort of legendary weapon. “Listen up, everyone!” he declared, his icing eyebrows furrowed with intense seriousness. “We now officially enter phase one of Operation: Moral-From-Another-World Saves this World.” Orion blinked. “Please tell me that’s not the real name.” A loud and sweet laugh left Pryde’s icing mouth. “It was either that or Operation: Frostmageddon Rebellion,” Pryde replied. “And Lumina said that sounded too theatrical.” Koa grunted. “It was too theatrical.”

Before Orion could respond, another figure waddled toward them from behind a boulder- short, round, and wearing a navy coat with silver toggles. A penguin, but not the goofy cartoonish kind. She moved with a sort of sharp precision, like a scout who’d spent years navigating treacherous ice fields. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she observed Orion. “So, this is the outsider?” Pryde hopped up and down. “Yep! The moral from the prophecy! The one destined to dethrone the icicle overlord!” Lumina tilted her head, her antlers poking at Koa’s ear. “Koa said the prophecy might refer to him,” Lumina corrected gently. “Well, he’s here,” the penguin said simply. “And timing couldn’t be worse. Snowtroopers are advancing toward Frostbine Ridge.” She lifted her head. “I’m Norei. I’ll be leading us from here.” Orion could not have been anymore confused.
“Orion,” he said awkwardly. “And this is Fenris.” Norei nodded in acknowledgment, which seemed to be her version of a greeting. “We need to move. Chillington’s scouts don’t miss footprints.” Koa motioned for Orion to follow as the group set off across the snow.
The voyage felt like hours. The fierce wind clawed at Orion’s face, making every breath feel like inhaling shards of ice. His legs burned from walking through knee-deep snow. Fenris trotted beside him, his tail leaving little streaks through the powder. “So, what exactly is the plan?” Orion asked while trying to keep pace with Lumina’s long strides. Koa answered without looking back. “First, we take you to a small igloo that was built on a mountain with a perfect view of King Chillington’s castle. That’s where the rebellion is organized.” Orion raised a brow in question, “And then?” Orion asked. Norei glanced at him, her feathers ruffling. “Then we figure out what part you’re meant to play. The prophecy says that only someone unbound by Borealheim’s history can expose Chillington’s great lie.” Pryde jumped in front of Orion dramatically. “Basically, you’re immune to his creepy snow magic.”
Immune? How so? Orion was a human- a moral. “I… am?” Orion asked. “How do you know?” Pryde let out a soft sigh while somehow managing to match Orion’s pace despite his very small size. “Well,” Pryde said thoughtfully, “you’re not frozen solid yet. So that’s a good sign.” Orion’s stomach twisted. “What- does he freeze people?” Koa nodded grimly. “Only the creatures who rebel against him and his family’s legacy.” Fantastic. Orion had somehow stepped into a magical dystopia. And he didn’t even have his winter jacket.

They stopped only once- right by the mountain they had to climb. They were going to continue their voyage the next day, so to wait, they decided to stay in a cave. Orion flopped onto the ground, exhausted, as Fenris curled up beside him. The others kept watch. He was just beginning to doze when Norei stepped toward him. “You’re quiet,” she said. “I’m overwhelmed to say the least,” he admitted. “Good,” she said, but softly. “Someone who isn’t overwhelmed by war is someone to fear. It means they underestimate dangers that can leave them vulnerable.” Orion looked at her. “Do you think I can actually help you defeat him?” Norei didn’t answer at first. But, she then let out a soft sigh, her expression unreadable. Finally, she said, “Prophecies are rarely about strength. Sometimes they’re about timing. Or courage. Or truth.” She faced him. “The fact that you’re here means something.” Orion wasn’t sure whether that reassured him or terrified him. But, it only heightened his determination to save this world. And return home.
By sunset the next day, the group reached the meeting point, the peak of the mountain. Looking in the direction of the sun was a perfect view of a castle, nestled between enormous frost pillars, was a glowing fortress. Spires of carved ice rose like elegant towers, illuminated by lanterns that cast blue-gold light through the night. Orion’s breath caught. “It’s… beautiful.” “Don’t be hypnotized by that castle’s beauty,” Lumina said. “What lies in there is very ugly.” As they descended, creatures of all kinds emerged- foxes wearing armor, owls with crystal amulets, even a few elves with braided silver hair and frost-coated cloaks. They stared at Orion with a mixture of awe and suspicion. They go inside the igloo in preparation. A large polar bear wearing a mantle of woven frost approached. “You have brought the moral,” he gleamed. Orion instinctively stepped back. Pryde whispered, “Don’t worry. Ursar is a teddy bear at heart. A really big one. With claws.” Ursar leaned down, studying Orion. “Do you understand the significance of your arrival?” Ursar’s voice was chilly in a way that was cold. Unsettling, and cold to the touch. Literally. “Um…” Orion said, “based on everything everyone keeps telling me… kind of?” That earned a deep laugh that shook the hall. “Good. Overconfidence is foolishness. But fear can be shaped into bravery.” Norei stepped forward. “Chillington is growing stronger. He’s developing a monstrous device at his castle- something powered by the Frozen Chalice.” At the mention of the artifact, the hall grew eerily silent.
Lumina explained quietly to Orion, “The Frozen Chalice controls all ice storms. With it, Chillington keeps the land locked in winter.” Orion was intrigued yet afraid. “So… what do I do?” Orion asked. Koa pointed to a large, ancient map etched in the ice floor. “You break into the castle, then find a stronghold - and get close enough to shatter the Chalice. Only someone from another world can resist its influence long enough to break it.” Orion’s stomach lurched. “You want me to break into the villain’s castle?!” Norei smirked faintly. “With us. You’re not going alone.” Ursar lifted a massive paw. “Tonight, we will feast. Tomorrow, we will fight.”

Morning came thick with fog. Everyone wore armor that seemed to be resistant to overly cold temperatures. Fenris wore a tiny leather vest that made him look extremely proud of himself. The group approached Frostspire Castle through a network of tunnels beneath the ice. When they reached the frozen aqueduct, Orion followed closely behind Norei. Pryde scurried ahead, whispering, “Careful… Snowtroopers hear everything.” Right on cue, a faint metallic stomp echoed down the corridor. The group froze, paralyzed in fear. Norei signaled for silence. A Snowtrooper, a tall, icy humanoid with glowing eyes and a jagged carrot nose, marched past, unaware of them. The moment it turned a corner, they continued.
Eventually, the tunnel opened into the heart of the castle. A massive throne room carved from pure black ice. At the center stood King Chillington- tall, imposing, sculpted from snow packed so tightly he looked like marble. His crown glimmered with frozen spikes, and his eyes glowed with malevolent cold. “So,” Chillington said, his voice echoing through the chamber, “the prophecy moral arrives.” Orion nearly stumbled backward, but Norei steadied him. Chillington raised one long, icy stick-arm. At its end, floating above his palm, was the Frozen Chalice- a cup made of crystallized storm clouds, swirling violently. “Come closer,” Chillington taunted. “Let me see what makes you so special.” Orion forced himself to take a step. His heart hammered so hard he felt dizzy. Lumina whispered from behind him, “You can resist. Believe it.”
Chillington sneered. “You are nothing.” Orion stepped closer, “You’re wrong,” he said quietly. Then, with a sudden surge of courage- or stupidity- Orion lunged forward and grabbed the chalice with both hands. A blast of icy power surged through him like lightning. He screamed. His vision shattered into swirling snowflakes. He felt the storm’s fury tearing at his mind, trying to freeze his thoughts solid. But he held on. And, after what seemed to be eternal, he slammed the chalice onto the ground. It cracked. Then shattered. A shockwave exploded across the throne room. Chillington howled as frost broke away from his body, melting rapidly. “No- No! You foolish child!” With one final roar, Chillington collapsed into a heap of slush that slowly dissolved across the icy floor. The tyrant was gone.

Silence followed. Then cheers erupted. Koa grinned-actually grinned. “About time someone knocked that pompous snow pile down.” Lumina bowed her head with tears in her eyes. “Borealheim is free.” A soft laugh left Norei’s beak before she corrected Lumina. “Eunoctis. This is Eunoctis.” Pryde flung himself onto Orion’s shoulder. “Never doubted you for a second! Well… maybe for a few seconds… but I mostly didn’t doubt you!” Fenris barked joyfully and tackled Orion into the snow. Orion laughed, breathlessly. “I can’t believe that worked.”
Orion expected to wake up back in his world the next day. He didn’t. Days became weeks. Weeks became seasons- well, the Borealheim version of seasons. The eternal winter slowly softened as the weather stabilized. Flowers that hadn’t bloomed in centuries emerged through thawing ice. Villages returned to life. He helped rebuild the evil castle, transforming it from a symbol of oppression into a sanctuary of peace. He trained under Norei, learning to navigate glaciers and cliffs. He learned magic from Lumina, mastering subtle spells of warmth and light. He sparred with Koa and developed surprising combat skills- nothing too elaborate, but enough to defend himself. He even earned the title “Orion Frostbound, Guardian of Eunoctis.” Thirty years passed like a dream full of victories, friendships, blizzards, festivals, perilous expeditions, and stories only he and the creatures could ever understand. He never stopped wondering if he’d return home. But he also never expected it to happen so abruptly.
One crisp morning, Orion walked with Fenris near a newly thawed lake in the Starlit Grove. The surface shimmered like liquid silver. He leaned down to touch the water. And the world collapsed beneath him. He fell through the pond like it was a doorway. Like it was the snowglobe all over again. Fenris yelped as they tumbled through swirling white. Then, Orion hit a cold tile. He gasped. He was inside The Gilded Reliquary. The antique shop. Mrs. Elderwood stood exactly where she had thirty seconds earlier. “Ah,” she said pleasantly, “you shook the snowglobe. Lovely effect, isn’t it?” Orion stared at her, trembling. Thirty years in Eunoctis. But his clothes were the same. His hair was the same length. Fenris looked the same. His watch said only thirty seconds had passed.
“Mrs. Elderwood,” Orion whispered, voice shaking, “I was gone.” Her jade eyes sparkled knowingly behind her rosy glasses. “Were you?” she asked softly. “Or did time simply choose kindness today?” Orion clutched Fenris’s fur, overwhelmed. He had lived a lifetime in another world. Saved a kingdom. Found family. Fought a tyrant. And yet… he was back. Everything is normal. Almost. Because when he looked at his reflection in the snowglobe’s surface, his eyes, once plain brown, now glimmered faintly with frost-blue light. Lumina’s color. He smiled, small, bittersweet. He didn’t know if he’d return to Eunoctis. But he knew one thing: Eunoctis would always live inside him. And maybe, if the snowglobe ever shimmered again… He would be ready.
“Mom, Dad, I’m home! I found the perfect Christmas gift!” Orion felt the same as he was before he had been to Eunoctis. But, one thing is for sure. He wasn’t the same. He had gained more confidence and bravery than ever before. But, at least he is still the same compassionate and heartfelt soul as he always was.

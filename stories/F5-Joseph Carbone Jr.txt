The Night Before Christmas
The Night Before Christmas
By Joseph
Flashing lights and carolers singing very loudly outside annoyed Thomas. He hated the Christmas season, referring to it as the most "stupid" holiday anyone ever invented. He was against the idea of giving gifts, trees, singing, or just about people being merry for a few weeks and then returning to misery. A rude old man who didn't want his life to change.
Thomas was seventy-three and lived alone. He never knew his biological family because he was adopted as a baby. The adoptive family that raised him was distant and strict, and they never talked about emotions or holidays or anything that resembled warmth. Now that they were all gone, he spent most holidays by himself. Every year December rolled around, and every year he told himself it didn’t bother him. The truth was that it did, and he had gotten good at pretending it didn’t.
He had spent the entire day indoors, playing his classical music at full blast to mask the carolers outside. Finally, after hours of this self-imposed isolation, his stomach began to rumble, and he got up. He shuffled down the stairs, grumbling as he went, passing by the decorations his neighbors had erected in the building lobby: fake snow, plastic reindeer, and a “Merry Christmas” sign that blinked on and off. It all made him tired.
As he stepped outside, the cold air pushed up. He grinded his hands into his pockets and checked his cell phone. The nearest Burger King was five minutes away. Good enough. He started walking stiffly, irritated.
On his way, he bumped into a man in a Santa Claus costume ringing a bell outside a charity stand. The man turned to him, yelling.
“Merry Christmas!”
"Shut up. Get out of my way," Thomas snapped without even looking at him.
"Whoa," said the man, lowering his bell. "What's your problem, man? It's Christmas Eve."
“There is no problem except that you're standing in the middle of the sidewalk like an idiot.”
The Santa-dressed man stepped closer. “You don’t have to be rude.”
Thomas had shoved him. The man had shoved back. In a matter of seconds, the argument turned into a fight. People started recording on their phones, someone yelled for help, and a few minutes later, flashing blue lights cut through the night.
The police pulled them apart, dragged them off to separate cars. Thomas didn't fight it. He was too fed up, too starving, and too tired to explain himself.
At the station, he was sitting in a steel chair across from a fatigued officer that had probably handled stranger cases that night.
“I didn’t start anything,” Thomas exclaimed. “I was walking to get food, and that clown decided to get in my way.”
The officer raised an eyebrow. “We have witnesses saying you shoved him first.”
"Because he wouldn't move."
"Sir, you attacked a man in a Santa suit. On Christmas Eve."
Thomas looked away. "I don't care what day it is."
The officer sighed and rubbed his forehead. "Look. No one is pressing charges. The guy you fought with already calmed down and said he was dressed up to collect donations for a homeless shelter. He doesn't want to make a big deal out of it. But I need to ask you something. Why are you so angry tonight?"
Thomas snorted. “I’m always angry.”
"Why? It's not illegal to have feelings."
Thomas shifted uncomfortably. He wasn't used to anyone asking him that. He wasn't used to anyone caring, even a little.
"It's Christmas," he finally said. "People get loud. They act phony. They pretend everything is perfect. I don't have anyone. Haven't had anyone in decades. It's easier to hate the holiday than think about that."
The officer studied him a moment. “That’s tough. I get it more than you think. But you can’t go around picking fights with Santa.”
Thomas huffed out a laugh he didn't mean to let slip. The officer smiled a little.
A knock came at the door, and another officer stepped inside. “He’s clear to go,” she said. “And the other guy said he wants to talk to him.”
Thomas frowned. “Why? Didn’t he get enough of me tonight?”
“No idea. He’s waiting.”
They walked him into the lobby, where the Santa-suit man stood without his beard and hat. He looked somewhat younger than Thomas had thought, in his forties. His name tag read Calvin.
Calvin stepped forward. "Hey. I'm not mad anymore. I shouldn't have snapped at you, either."
Thomas said nothing.
Calvin hesitated. "Look, man, I run the shelter a few blocks down; I have been doing this Santa thing each year. Usually, people are nicer than that, but, hey, nights get rough around holidays. I figured since neither of us wants to spend Christmas Eve angry, maybe we just call it even.
Thomas stared at him. “You came all the way here just to say that?”
“Well, that and I saw you walking towards Burger King before the two of us bumped into one another. Probably you haven’t eaten yet?
“Not really.”
"I was about to go drop off the donations anyway. You could come by the shelter. We've got volunteers serving hot food right now. It's free. No sign-ups or anything."
Thomas blinked. “I’m not homeless.”
“I didn’t say you were.” Calvin gave a small, understanding smile. “You just look like someone who could use a warm meal and a place where people aren’t yelling.”
Thomas almost said no. His instinct was to refuse anything that involved being around other people. But something about the offer, or maybe just the day he’d had, made him pause.
"…Fine," he growled. "Just for a minute."
Calvin took him down the street to a shelter, an old brick building that someone had tried to make festive with paper snowflakes and cheap string lights. Inside, it smelled of soup and roasted chicken; people sat at long tables, talking softly. Volunteers passed out blankets and hot chocolate.
A young woman near the entrance greeted them. “Hey, Calvin. Who’s your friend?”
“Just someone who needs a plate,” Calvin replied.
Thomas found himself at a table set with a hot meal he didn't have to pay for. He had eaten silently at first, without looking at anyone. But a little boy across the table kept looking at him.
The boy finally spoke. “Is that your coat? My grandpa used to have one just like it.”
Thomas looked up, confused. “Uh… yes. It’s mine.”
The boy nodded, satisfied, and went back to eating. Something about that simple interaction made Thomas feel a wave of warmth he couldn't quite name.
Over the course of the next hour, he spoke to a few people. He found out the staff spent all year raising money to keep the place open. He found out Calvin was once homeless himself. And Thomas, for the first time in a long time, didn't feel invisible.
When he stood to leave, Calvin walked with him to the door.
“You know,” Calvin said, “we’re having breakfast tomorrow morning, too. You’re welcome to come back.”
Thomas looked at him long enough. Outside, the night had wound down now into that kind of stillness which is a clean slate.
“Perhaps I will,” he said quietly.
The cold air was filled with an unfamiliar surprise. Not joy, precisely. But not loneliness either. Something in between. An emotion that was no more than the first hint of a change he had not known he needed.
It was still the night before Christmas. He still didn’t love the holiday. But for the first time, he didn’t hate it either.
He walked home slowly, his hands in his pockets, and knew that he was less alone tonight than he had felt at the beginning. For him, that was enough.

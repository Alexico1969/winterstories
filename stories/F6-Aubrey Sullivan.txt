Winter Story
By Aubrey
One stormy day, Bella and her friends went to a bakery to get some dessert for after dinner. As they waited, they ordered cocoa and talked while the storm rumbled outside. When the bakery closed and the girls went to leave, Bella tried to open the door—but it didn’t budge. Panic rose as Isabella pushed and pulled, but the door was jammed. Mrs. Smith, the bakery owner, and her granddaughter tried unlocking it, but nothing worked. They finally accepted that they were stuck inside the bakery for the night.
Not knowing what else to do, John suggested turning up the heat and trying the door again later. Jamie offered to warm pies and hot cocoa while everyone waited. Mrs. Smith opened an old cupboard, its door barely hanging on, and pulled out a couple of games to help pass the time. When the treats were ready, everyone gathered around as they opened an old dusty game.
“Candy Land,” Bella read aloud. “Be the first to get to Grandma’s bakery. Roll the dice, move your pawn, but don’t get trapped in candy-cane jail.” Bella, her friends, and the Smiths laughed and began playing. They moved their colorful pieces around the board as the storm continued outside.
Eventually, they grew tired and went upstairs to the cots. As they slept, they were transported into the game. They hiked up ice cream mountains, swam across licorice lakes, and pushed through frosty candy paths, all trying to reach Grandma’s house.
Bella slowly opened her eyes and realized they weren’t dreaming—they were actually inside the game. They found a card that read, “Make it to the end of the game to return home.” James encouraged everyone to remain calm and continue playing.
Olivia eagerly went first. She pushed the giant sugar cube dice, and it landed on six—a quest card. “You and the next player gather five gummy bears to move another three spaces,” Jamie read. Olivia grabbed Bella, and together they went into the gummy bear forest to retrieve the five candy bears. They lined them up and moved forward three spaces.
James ran to the dice next and rolled a four. “Free space—enjoy a nice popsicle!” he cheered. They continued taking turns, completing quests and earning rewards.
Suddenly, a yeti monster appeared from the snowy slopes. It told them they had to find the magical yeti necklace hidden in the candy forest. They searched through cotton candy bushes until Mrs. Smith finally called out, “I found it!” The yeti congratulated them and sent them on their way.
At last, they reached the end of the board. All they needed was a roll of six to escape. Bella lifted the giant sugar cube dice—but before she could roll, she heard her mom’s voice calling her.
“Bella, wake up! You’re going to be late!” Bella sat up. She had been dreaming the whole time—no magical game, no candy forest, no snowed-in bakery.

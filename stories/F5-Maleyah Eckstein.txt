Winter Story
Winter Story
The snow wasn’t supposed to start until late evening, at least according to the weather app everyone checked this morning. But by the time the final bell rang at West Ridge High, thick white flakes were already falling fast, sticking to the windows and coating the parking lot. Most students hurried home, but a lot stayed in for after-school activities like basketball practice, drama club, tutoring, and the yearbook meeting.
Kayla was one of the yearbook editors, though she rarely talked during meetings. She mostly listened and typed notes, staying in the background. Today, she had planned to finish captions for the winter sports page. She didn’t notice the snow building outside until the lights in the library flickered slightly.
”Did you feel that?” Maya asked, hugging her binder to her chest. She always stressed about due dates.
”It’s just the wind ,” Ethan said from across the table, feet kicked up on a chair. “Relax.”
But a few minutes later, the intercom buzzed. “Attention students,” the principal announced. “Due to dangerous road conditions, all after-school buses are canceled. Parents should delay pickup until further notice. Please stay where you are.”
Maya’s mouth dropped open. “You’re kidding.”
Ethan grinned.

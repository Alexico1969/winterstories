Snowball Fight
Snowball Fight
By Lucas Encalada
The first real snowfall of December came late that year, drifting silently from a sky that looked like brushed pewter. At first, the flakes were small, powdery, scattered, hesitant, but by afternoon they thickened into big, feathery clusters that clung to hair and jacket sleeves. By nightfall, the entire town of Redbridge lay beneath a soft, glittering blanket, and every kid in the neighborhood went to bed buzzing with anticipation.
By morning, the world was transformed. Lawns, roofs, trees, and even the quiet road running through the neighborhood were covered in snow so smooth it could have been rolled out by magic. For most, it was just a pretty winter day. But for the kids of Willow Street, it was so much more. Snow like that meant only one thing, an epic snowfight.
Twelve year old Ethan was the first one outside; he had barely zipped his coat when he started rolling a ball of snow across the yard, laughing as it picked up leaves, twigs, and even more snow. Soon his best friends Sam, Olivia, Marcus, and little Noah joined him. The group always played together, but something about snow transformed them from ordinary kids into soldiers of winter warfare. Olivia was the strategist, always insisting they build a fort “properly” with dugouts and a trench. Marcus was the daredevil, sprinting across enemy lines with wild energy. Noah, the youngest being nine, was enthusiastic but terrible at aiming. And then there was Sam, quiet but steady, the one who kept things fair. Ethan, though, was the unofficial leader. He was quick, funny, and could pack a snowball with perfect precision.
On that particular morning, the kids decided to divide into two teams; Ethan, Noah, and Olivia on one side; Sam and Marcus on the other. They set up their forts on opposite ends of Ethan's backyard, which, thanks to a slight hill, made the battlefield feel grander than it actually was. “Ready?” Ethan shouted, his breath misting in the cold, “Ready!” the others echoed.
The battle began with a flurry of snowballs erupting through the air. Noah shrieked joyfully every time he got hit, even when he was supposed to be hiding behind the wall. Olivia kept yelling commands, “Go left! Go right! No, Noah, stop eating snow!” while Ethan laughed so hard he nearly dropped his snowballs. On the opposing side, Marcus charged fearlessly up the hill like a one-man snowstorm with Sam following behind, trying to provide cover fire, but his gloves were too thick for good aim. Snowballs soared, kids shouted, someone slipped and fell dramatically on purpose. The whole backyard echoed with laughter that rose into the cold winter sky.
And then something changed. During one of the battlefield lulls, Marcus decided to roll what he called a “mega snowball,” packed tight. Too tight. Without thinking, he pressed the snow harder and harder, and the moisture on his gloves froze around the ball, turning its outer layer into hard ice. It wasn’t meant to be dangerous, just impressive. But Marcus, caught up in the thrill, didn’t realize what he’d made.
When the next round began, Ethan popped up from behind his fort to shout, “Retreat Noah! Retreat!” He was grinning, mid-laugh, cheeks flushed with cold. And at that exact moment, Marcus launched his “mega ball.” Everything happened too fast for anyone to react. The icy snowball struck Ethan right on his forehead. He fell over instantly.
For a heartbeat, the world went silent. Snowflakes drifted past. The laughter died in the kids’ throats. No one moved. Then Olivia screamed. Sam was the first to reach Ethan, dropping to his knees beside him. “Ethan? Ethan, wake up!” He shook his shoulder gently, panic rising in his chest. Noah began sobbing, and Marcus stood frozen a few feet away, the color drained from his face.
Within minutes that felt like hours, Ethan’s mother burst out the back door, sprinting across the snow. The ambulance arrived shortly after. The kids huddled together on the porch shivering not from the cold but from fear as EMTs lifted Ethan onto a stretcher. “He’s breathing,” one of them said, “But he’s unresponsive.” The ambulance lights reflected off the snow, casting red and blue flashes across the yard. And then Ethan was gone, swallowed by the back doors that slammed shut behind him.
Ethan’s friends weren’t allowed to ride in the ambulance, but they arrived soon after with their parents. The waiting room felt way too bright, too quiet, too wrong. Christmas decorations lined the walls with tinsel garlands, paper snowflakes, a fake pine tree decorated with red bows, but none of it felt festive. Hours later, the doctor finally spoke with Ethan’s parents. “A significant concussion,” they explained. “He’s in a coma. We don’t know for how long.” Marcus overheard. He burst into tears so hard his father had to take him outside.
The days that followed passed in a slow, painful blur. The kids visited the hospital often, sometimes together, sometimes alone. They’d sit with Ethan, who would lay pale and still, hooked up to monitors that beeped softly in the dim room. Snow kept falling outside, coating the world in white, but the room felt timeless and colorless.
Noah brought Ethan his favorite action figure and placed it on the bedside table “so he won’t be lonely.” Olivia wrote letters every night, folding them and placing them in a little Christmas box she brought to the room. Sam talked to Ethan about school, neighbors, jokes, anything, hoping his voice might reach him. Marcus visited the least, not because he didn’t care, but because he cared too much. Every time he stepped into the room, he felt the weight of what happened crush him all over again.
The hospital staff put up a Christmas tree on top of his night stand. Families walked the halls with cookies, volunteers sang carols, and someone even dressed up as Santa. But the kids of Willow Street couldn’t bring themselves to enjoy any of it.
Christmas Eve came, wrapped in quiet snow and heavy hearts. Ethan had been unconscious for eleven days. It was just past sunrise on Christmas morning when Ethan’s mother, asleep in the chair beside his bed, felt something shift. She opened her eyes tiredly and saw Ethan’s hand twitch. She blinked, half thinking she had imagined it. Then his eyelids fluttered.
“Ethan?” she whispered, standing so fast the chair clattered backward. A small sound escaped him more breath than voice. His fingers moved again, curling weakly. Doctors were called. Nurses rushed in. The room filled with soft urgency. Within minutes, Ethan’s eyes opened fully. He was groggy, confused, but awake, and more importantly alive.
Word spread through the hospital almost instantly. His friends burst into the room in a chaotic wave of relief, Noah crying openly, Olivia nearly tackling Ethan with the gentlest hug she could manage, Sam grinning so wide his face hurt, and Marcus standing frozen with tears in his eyes. “I’m sorry,” Marcus choked out. “I didn’t mean to, I didn’t know” Ethan, still weak, reached out his hand. “It’s okay,” he said, voice raspy but warm. “It was an accident.” Marcus broke down completely then, sobbing into Sam’s shoulder while everyone laughed and cried at the same time.
The doctor later said, “Sometimes recovery happens gradually, and sometimes, well, feels like a miracle. Waking up on Christmas morning? No better gift.” Ethan spent another week recovering, but he was expected to make a full recovery. The snow outside remained deep, but the kids didn’t dare start another snowfight, not yet, and definitely not with any hard snow. Instead, they built snowmen, drank cocoa, and stuck close to Ethan every chance they got.
When New Year’s arrived, the world felt bright again. The accident became a memory that was painful, but one that drew them closer. And for years afterward, whenever someone asked Ethan what the best Christmas gift he ever received was, he didn’t hesitate. “Waking up,” he’d say. “And realizing I wasn’t alone.” Because in the end, the magic of that Christmas was the warmth, the love, the friendship that refused to let go. And in some quiet, unexplainable way, the spirit of Christmas had carried him through the darkest winter night and back into the light.

Winter Story
A Short Story by Matthew
There was once a boy named Eli who no longer felt the magic of Christmas. While other kids
        in his small snowy town counted down the days until Christmas morning, Eli only felt empty
        and annoyed. The lights seemed too bright, the music too loud, and the cheer too fake.
        Everyone smiled as if the world were perfect, but inside, Eli felt cold and forgotten.
So instead of joining in the joy, he decided to ruin it. It started small. One afternoon,
        Eli walked past a yard where two little girls were building a snowman. They had given it a
        carrot nose and a crooked scarf, and they were laughing louder than the bells on a sleigh.
        Eli scowled.
As they ran inside to grab buttons for eyes, he marched up and kicked the snowman’s base.
        It collapsed in a soft
whoomp
. The girls came running outside and burst into tears
        while Eli walked away pretending not to care.
Then came the snowballs. Eli hid behind a fence and pelted people as they passed by—teenagers
        walking with cocoa, a dad carrying a wreath, even an old lady with a basket of cookies.
        He laughed when they yelped in surprise, but the laughter didn’t actually make him feel better.
        It only made the emptiness louder.
One evening, he went to a small gathering outside the bakery where townspeople were sipping
        hot cocoa together. While no one was looking, Eli leaned over the table and squeezed a whole
        packet of hot sauce into the largest pot. Minutes later, coughing and complaints filled the
        air.
“Who would do something like this?” someone cried. Eli slipped away again.
Nothing, however, was worse than what he did next.
That night was the town’s annual Christmas tree lighting. Every year, the whole town gathered
        in the square to sing carols and count down as the mayor flipped the switch. The enormous tree
        glittered with thousands of tiny lights, and for one moment, everyone felt warm—even in the
        deep winter cold.
Eli snuck behind the old electric station and yanked the power cord. The lights died. Gasps
        filled the square. Children clutched their parents. The music stopped. The tree was dark and
        lifeless, and the moment that everyone waited a whole year for… was gone.
People were furious. It didn’t take long for someone to figure out it was Eli. And soon, the
        hate spread—not just toward him, but toward his family.
“Must be how he was raised,” a woman whispered.  
        “That whole family is bad news,” another man muttered.
Eli heard everything. For the first time, the hole in his chest didn’t feel empty anymore.
        It felt heavy. He hadn’t only ruined Christmas for strangers—he had hurt his parents, his
        sister, his entire family.
His throat tightened. His eyes stung. He didn’t want to go home. He didn’t feel like he
        deserved to. So he walked.
The snow crunched beneath his boots until he reached the park. The swings sat still.
        The pond was frozen. Only one bench wasn’t covered in snow—someone had been sitting there
        recently. And then someone sat down again.
A man dressed as Santa Claus.
Not a mall Santa. Not a costume-store Santa. This one looked… real. The suit was worn, the
        beard soft and snowy, and his eyes were warm like glowing embers in a fireplace.
“What’s wrong, son?” Santa asked kindly.
Eli hesitated, then everything spilled out—the snowman, the snowballs, the hot sauce, the
        power outage. By the time he finished, tears were streaming down his face.
“I didn’t mean to hurt my family,” he whispered. “I just… didn’t care about anything anymore.”
Santa didn’t interrupt. He only nodded and listened. When Eli finished, Santa asked softly,
        “What do you want for Christmas?”
Eli sniffed and looked down. “I wish… I could undo today. I wish I could redo Christmas.”
Santa smiled—not big, not loud. Just warm. “Then I hope you use it wisely,” he said.
A moment later, Santa stood up, brushed snow from his coat… and walked away.
Eli blinked. And he was gone.
Confused, Eli slowly went home and collapsed into his bed.
The next morning, his alarm went off. He grabbed his phone. December 23rd.  
        The same as yesterday.
His heart leapt into his throat.
“It worked,” he whispered.
He jumped out of bed and ran outside. The snowman was standing. The girls were laughing.
        The lights were uncut.
Eli took a deep breath and did something new.
He helped.
He helped rebuild snowmen. He apologized to the girls. He warned the bakery about the cocoa.
        He helped shovel driveways. When kids walked by, he smiled… and didn’t throw anything.
That evening, when the town gathered for the tree lighting, Eli stood beside his family.
And this time, he didn’t pull any cords.
The mayor counted down.
Five…
Four…
Three…
Two…
One…
The tree exploded into light.
Gasps and cheers filled the air as the tree shimmered brighter than ever.
And for the first time in a long while—Eli felt warm.  
        Not from the lights.  
        From inside.
And when he turned toward the edge of the crowd, he thought he saw a familiar red coat
        disappearing into the snow.
Smiling.

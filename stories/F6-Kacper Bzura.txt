The Night the Star Fell
The Night the Star Fell
By Kacper
Most people in my town don’t really notice the Christmas Star anymore. It’s this big glowing light that appears above the old church every year around December 19th. It’s been happening since before my grandparents were born, and everyone just calls it a tradition. Nobody knows how it works, and nobody has ever actually gotten close to it.
But this year, something completely different happened, and I was the only person who saw it.
My name is keney , I’m thirteen, and I’m not the kid who goes looking for trouble. But when you see a star fall out of the sky, it’s impossible not to check it out. At least, that’s what I told myself.
It all started on Christmas Eve. My parents were arguing in the kitchen about whether the cow was cooked all the way through, and my little sister, Fiona, was running around chasing our dog with rope. I stepped outside just to get some air. The whole street was lit up blue and red from Christmas lights, and everything looked normal. Then I looked up.
The Christmas Star, the same one that shows up every single year, suddenly flickered, turned brighter than I’d ever seen, and then shot downward super fast. It didn’t explode or anything. It looked more like someone pulled it down on a string. It disappeared behind the trees of Redwood Forest, the huge woods behind our neighborhood.
Nobody else saw. Nobody else even looked up. I stood there for maybe a full minute with my mouth open. And then I grabbed my jacket and my boots.
I didn’t tell anyone where I was going because I knew what my parents would say. My dad would make that face he makes when he thinks I’m being annoying, and my mom would say it was probably “some kind of drone.” But I knew what I saw. And something inside me felt like I was supposed to find it.
The snow was deeper and higher than I expected when I reached the forest entrance. Blackpine Forest always looked kind of creepy and scary, even during the day. At night, it was just a giant wall of dark trees and cold air. It was the kind of place where every sound makes you think something’s following you. Still, I entered in.
At first nothing happened. I walked through the woods, following the direction the star fell. My breath came out in smoke, and the only noise was the crunch of snow under my boots. But the deeper I went, the more I started noticing weird things.
First, the trees looked wrong. They didn’t look like pine trees anymore. The branches were too long, drooping like they were tired. And the snow on the ground wasn’t pure white—it had a faint blue glow to it, like the leftovers of whatever the star was made of. When I touched it, it felt warm for a second, which honestly freaked me out and I almost left.
Then I heard footsteps behind me. I jumped around, expecting a deer or something, but instead there was this animal staring at me. It looked like a fox, but thinner, with fur that was bright like a star. When it blinked, tiny sparks came off its eyes, drifting away like dust. I froze, unsure if it was friendly, but it just tilted its head and then trotted away.
For some reason, I followed it. I don’t know why. It felt like the forest was forcing me in that direction.
The fox led me through a narrow path I swear wasn’t there before. It ducked under a branch, and when I pushed the branch aside and stepped through, I saw it. The fallen star.
Except it wasn’t really a star like the ones in the sky. It was a glowing orb, about the size of a basketball, cracked down the middle like someone had dropped it. It was lying in a small tree stump, lighting up the snow around it with a soft gold color. The fox sat beside it, staring at me like it was waiting for me to do something.
I said hi to it. I don’t know why I talked to it, but talking to a fox felt less weird than talking to a star.
When I got closer, the orb moved—just enough that I could tell it was alive somehow. I touched it before I could think about whether that was stupid. The moment my fingers touched the surface, a wave of warm air shot up my arm and through my chest. Then a voice echoed in my head. Not loud, not scary, just a whisper: get me back.
I fell back, almost into the snow. The fox stared more intensely than any animal ever had.
I suddenly understood. The Christmas Star wasn’t just some decoration. It was what kept winter going. Without it, the forest might freeze over completely, or maybe the seasons would stop changing. I didn’t know the exact details, but I knew it needed to go back—to the top of the church tower.
The fox pushed the orb toward me. I picked it up. It felt like holding a warm snowball. The fox ran ahead, guiding me.
The forest was alive now, shifting around me. Paths I’d taken earlier were gone. New ones appeared. At one point the trees leaned so tightly I had to crawl under them. But the fox kept checking on me.
Finally, I saw the neighborhood lights. The fox stopped at the woods’ edge. When I looked back, it was gone.
I ran to the church. The doors were locked, so I climbed the side ladder workers used. My hands were freezing, and twice I almost slipped, but the orb was growing smaller. I didn’t know what would happen if it went out completely.
At the top, I placed the orb in the metal holder where the Christmas Star normally appeared. For a second, nothing happened. Then a burst of golden light shot upward, rising into the sky and settling into the shape of a star, glowing stronger than ever.
The whole town lit up. Christmas lights seemed brighter. The air felt heavier and colder, like winter had snapped back into place.
I climbed down slowly, legs shaking. When I got home, nobody even noticed I’d left. My parents were still arguing about the cow.
But later that night, when I looked out my window, I saw a small fox-shaped shadow sitting at the forest edge. Its eyes glowed once, like it was saying thank you, and then it disappeared.
I never told anyone about what happened. But sometimes, when the snow glows a little too bright, I wonder if the star remembers me.
